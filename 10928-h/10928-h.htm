<h2>The Jhee&rsquo;s Discovery</h2>
<p>It was the month of <i>Jaishta</i> (May-June) in Bengal, and the
earth languished under the scorching rays of the sun and sent up a
voiceless prayer to the Rain God to come soon and refresh the fields
and jungles with the welcome <i>&ldquo;barsat&rdquo;</i> (rainy
season).</p>
<p>Yet, in spite of the intense heat, a young and delicately nurtured
Bengali lady was travelling. She was on her way to pay a visit to her
parents-in-law, for after marriage the bride returns to her
childhood&rsquo;s home and remains there, paying visits from time to
time to her husband&rsquo;s home until the day comes when she goes to
live there.</p>
<p>It is a Bengali custom that ladies, especially young ladies, must
always wear their jewellery, even when travelling. Arms, wrists, neck
and ankles, bare of jewels, are a sign of widowhood or dire poverty.
Out young heroine was accordingly adorned with jewels and she was also
richly attired. Was she not the daughter of a wealthy man and going to
visit her mother-in-law? So her mother had lovingly dressed her in an
exquisite gold-embroidered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e193"
href="#xd20e193" name="xd20e193">2</a>]</span>Benares silk <i>saree</i>
of finest texture and superb workmanship, and the jewellery, which
adorned her graceful arms, neck and ankles, was in keeping with the
richness of her costume.</p>
<p>Twelve bearers took turns in carrying the covered palanquin or
<i>palki</i> in which she travelled. They had been in her
father&rsquo;s service for many years and were known, to be
trustworthy. A faithful <i>jhee</i> (maid) accompanied her, sometimes
walking beside the <i>palki</i> and at other times sitting within, to
fan her young mistress and help to enliven the weary journey with tales
of former travels. Two men-servants, whom in Bengal we call
<i>durwans</i> and who are permitted to bear arms in defence of their
masters&rsquo; goods, completed the party. One of them walked on either
side of the <i>palanquin</i> and each carried a naked sword in his
hand. These two men were tried and trusted retainers of the young
lady&rsquo;s father, and were prepared to defend their master&rsquo;s
daughter even at the cost of their lives.</p>
<p>The route lay through a lonely country district with stretches of
rice-fields scattered between, and villages nestling here and there
among groves of trees. At. one of these villages the party halted
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e217" href="#xd20e217" name=
"xd20e217">3</a>]</span>awhile for rest and refreshment, and then on
again in the fierce heat of a close Indian day.</p>
<p>Thus many miles had been passed; and the evening shades were
beginning to cool the wearisome day, when the travellers drew near to a
group of trees not far from a small tank (artificial lake). The
<i>palki</i>-bearers sighted this ideal resting-place and asked the
<i>jhee</i> to inform their young mistress of it, and beseech that they
might stop there and refresh themselves with a draught of water, after
which they would be able to travel still faster,</p>
<p>A gracious consent was readily given by the fair one within the
<i>palanquin</i>. She had found the heat almost beyond endurance, and
pitied the bearers who had the weight of her <i>palki</i> and herself
added to their sufferings.</p>
<p>The <i>palanquin</i> was gently set down under a large and shady
tree, and the <i>durwans</i> respectfully withdrew a little distance to
permit of the <i>jhee</i> raising the covering, so that their kind
mistress might also enjoy the grateful shade and coolness of the
grove.</p>
<p>The spot was lonely and their responsibility great, so the men
decided among themselves that they should divide into two parties. Six
should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e248" href="#xd20e248" name=
"xd20e248">4</a>]</span>remain with the guard to protect their fair
charge in case of any untoward happening while the other six refreshed
themselves at the lake.</p>
<p>This plan was no sooner agreed upon than the first six trooped off
gleefully towards the tank. The others stretched themselves in the
shade and relaxed their limbs in the interval of waiting.</p>
<p>Time passed unheeded till it dawned upon some of those who waited
that they still thirsted and that the first six seemed too long away.
They asked the <i>jhee</i> to obtain leave for them to go and hurry the
others up and refresh themselves at the same time, so that the journey
might soon be resumed as the evening sun was nearing the horizon, and
if they delayed further night would overtake them. The young lady gave
the desired permission and the second six soon disappeared towards the
tank. They too were long away!</p>
<p>The <i>jhee</i> felt uneasy but kept her fears to herself. Suddenly
she too disappeared. Without a word to her mistress she had decided to
see what the bearers were doing at the tank. Climbing up a tree, she
crept along an overhanging branch and a dreadful sight met her
horrified gaze. Some of the bearers lay dead in the shallow water and
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e263" href="#xd20e263" name=
"xd20e263">5</a>]</span>surviving ones were fighting desperately for
their lives with a small band of outlaws.</p>
<p>Rushing back to the <i>palki</i> with the utmost speed and
regardless of onlookers, she flung wide the door, screaming
frantically, &ldquo;Dacoits! dacoits! run, <i>didi</i> (elder sister),
run. With these eyes of mine I saw them. I climbed a tree and saw them.
Some of our bearers lie dead and they are killing the others. Fly! fly
for your life!&rdquo; With these words she turned and led the way with
swiftness impelled by fear.</p>
<p>The lonely occupant of the <i>palanquin</i> received the awful
tidings with horror and dismay. Often had she heard tales of dacoits
and their ruthless deeds. For a fleeting instant the thought, that she
must fall a victim to such desperados, paralysed her with fear; but
only for an instant. Her woman&rsquo;s wit and ingenuity moved her to
action. Quickly she divested herself of her heavy jewelled anklets. How
could she run thus weighted? and might not their value satisfy the
greed of the highwaymen? Flinging them down in the <i>palanquin</i>,
she hastily closed the doors and dropped the covering over its sides.
Let them think she was within. The search of the <i>palki</i> would
delay them awhile. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e284" href=
"#xd20e284" name="xd20e284">6</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then tucking up her rich <i>satee</i> she too started to run for her
life. She had gone but a few steps when the voices of the two
<i>durwans</i> arrested her. They had heard the <i>jhee&rsquo;s</i>
distracted cry, and their only thought was for their young
mistress.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Didi,&rdquo;</i> they said, addressing her affectionately
and respectfully by the endearing name of sister, which is a custom
permitted in Bengal to the servants of every household. In the home of
her girlhood a girl is addressed as <i>&ldquo;didi&rdquo;</i> (sister)
and in her father-in-law&rsquo;s house as <i>&ldquo;bow&rdquo;</i>
(son&rsquo;s wife). Sons of the family are addressed as
<i>&ldquo;dada&rdquo;</i> (brother, strictly elder brother) and
sons-in-law as <i>&ldquo;jamai&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Didi,</i> fear not! As long as there is breath in these
bodies we will defend you. If the dacoits overtake us, we will guard
you. No harm shall come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Encouraged by their presence and words, the girl made all possible
speed. But her delicate feet were unused to rough, hard roads, and,
despite her will and brave efforts, she tripped and stumbled
continually. In Bengal, in the hot dry weather, the country roads are
difficult to traverse. The deep ruts of the rainy season dry up and the
once muddy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e319" href="#xd20e319"
name="xd20e319">7</a>]</span>earth crumbles into thick heavy dust, into
which the feet of the wayfarers sink. Fast travelling is difficult even
for those who are used to journeying, so the poor young lady made
little headway and was soon overtaken by her pursuers. They had not
been long in discovering her flight and were soon racing after her from
under the tree. As she ran she heard their shouts, and then realised
that they had caught up with her guard who were resisting them.</p>
<p>The poor girl ran on and on alone, and presently saw a tiny hamlet
hidden among some trees. She made for this as fast as her trembling
limbs could carry her and rushed breathlessly into a small red
brick-house, the door of which stood slightly ajar, crying: &ldquo;Shut
the door! Dacoits are following me!&rdquo; Then, overcome with fear and
exhaustion, she sank unconscious upon the floor.</p>
<p>The ladies of the little household ran forward on hearing her cry
and shut the door promptly. Dacoits were known and feared everywhere.
Then they tenderly ministered to the stranger. As soon as she recovered
her senses, she related to them what had befallen her and implored
their protection.</p>
<p>The master of the house immediately despatched <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e327" href="#xd20e327" name=
"xd20e327">8</a>]</span>a messenger to a distant police outpost for
aid. Soothed and comforted, the girl eagerly hoped and prayed for the
arrival of her attendants.</p>
<p>After some time, word was brought in that a <i>palki</i> was
approaching. Even in the dark the approach of a <i>palki</i> is made
known by the rhythmic cries of the bearers. Soon it arrived in front of
the red brick-house and the bearers, halting, asked loudly if a strange
lady, richly attired and decked with jewels, was within. From an upper
window the master of the house answered them, while the girl and her
kindly hostess listened anxiously downstairs. The pseudo
<i>palki</i>-bearers next informed the listeners that they were the
servants of a very wealthy man and had been conveying his daughter to
her parents-in-law&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&rdquo; they boldly declared, &ldquo;our master&rsquo;s
daughter is such a troublesome girl. She causes us much anxiety
whenever she is sent to visit her mother-in-law. She is so unwilling to
go that it is with great difficulty that we get her safely
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The anxious listeners within felt sure these were the dacoits and
longed for the arrival of the police. The disguised thieves persisted
in their questioning for some time in spite of the house <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e345" href="#xd20e345" name=
"xd20e345">9</a>]</span>master&rsquo;s repeated advice that they had
better search elsewhere. At last they departed carrying the
<i>palki</i> with them. And the dwellers in the red brick-house
breathed more freely. But not for long.</p>
<p>The village was a tiny one and the pretended bearers soon returned
from their search. Planting the <i>palki</i> in the doorway, they
shouted: &ldquo;We know for certain that our mistress is hiding
somewhere. We feel sure she is in your house. Here we will sit till you
send her forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing these words the poor pursued girl fell at the feet of her
host, calling herself his daughter and addressing him as
&ldquo;father&rdquo;, and implored of him not to give her up to these
awful dacoits. The good man assured her of his protection while his
wife raised her from the floor, and, embracing her, said they would all
sooner suffer death than give her up.</p>
<p>The trying hours dragged on till past midnight. Then the dacoits
announced that the lady must be produced or they would force an
entrance into the house. No reply was given to this ultimatum. The
highwaymen waited awhile and then assailed the door with heavy blows.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e359" href="#xd20e359" name=
"xd20e359">10</a>]</span></p>
<p>The distraught girl besought her hostess to take her jewels and hand
them out to the burglars and thus ensure peace and safety for all. The
mistress of the house declared this would not satisfy the ruffians and
once more assured her guest that, whatever happened, they would strive
to protect her.</p>
<p>Presently the door gave way and, with coarse oaths and triumphant
threats, the dacoits entered. But unknown to them,&mdash;so busy had
they been hammering and swearing,&mdash;the police had arrived and now
followed in on their heels. The dacoits were all captured and confessed
their guilt as to the murder of the <i>palki</i>-bearers and the
probable death of the two <i>durwans</i>, who, they averred, had fought
like tigers.</p>
<p>The bodies of these two devoted servants were found, all battered
and bruised, on the roadside and were given honourable cremation by
their master, whose daughter they had saved by their devotion.</p>
<p>The <i>jhee</i> was found close to the spot, hiding among the
branches of a tree. She had witnessed the fight between the
<i>durwans</i> and dacoits and the flight and pursuit of her mistress.
When both reached home again, the <i>jhee</i> filled up dull hours with
vivid accounts of their adventure. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e383" href="#xd20e383" name="xd20e383">11</a>]</span> This little
story is a true one and shows how difficult and dangerous travel was in
the old days in Bengal. Travelling by <i>palki</i> is now in many parts
a thing of the past, for the whole Province is being linked together by
a network of railways. Good roads and better police arrangements also
lessen the terrors of travelling in places where railways are still
wanting. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e389" href="#xd20e389" name=

<h2>Trapped by a Cobra</h2>
<p>Not many years ago a young married lady was journeying alone.</p>
<p>It is not customary in India for young women, even if married, to go
out by themselves. The <i>purdah</i> system unfits them for
independence. Even when going for a short distance by <i>palanquin</i>
or just for a carriage drive, a chaperon is necessary.</p>
<p>Yet occasions arise when it is imperative that they should journey,
but no suitable escort can be found or spared for the purpose. They are
then obliged to go with servants. It may seem strange that young ladies
should be permitted to travel alone with servants. But readers who know
India will not be surprised, for Indians treat their servants after the
patriarchal system, especially those who have served the family for
generations. Even hired attendants, like the driver in this story, are
thoroughly trusted when known to the family.</p>
<p>The young lady was on her way to visit her father and mother. Indian
parents-in-law cannot visit at the parental home of their
daughter-in-law. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e407" href=
"#xd20e407" name="xd20e407">13</a>]</span>Therefore <i>bow-ma</i>
journeyed alone with her little son, a child of about five years of
age.</p>
<p>The distance was not a long one, only from Calcutta to Durgapore, a
village a few miles away from the city. So a hackney-carriage was hired
with a driver who had often before been employed by her father-in-law,
and everyone felt assured <i>bow-ma</i> would reach her destination
safely.</p>
<p>Her mother-in-law saw her into the carriage. Her little boy was
lifted up beside her, and, with many injunctions to drive carefully and
with speed ringing in his ears, the driver whipped up his horses and
they were off.</p>
<p><i>Bow-ma</i> knew the road well. Often had she journeyed to and fro
in the early years of her married life, and even after the birth of her
little son her visits to her parents had been frequent.</p>
<p>The carriage was close and her heavy silken <i>saree</i> hot to
wear, so she opened the venetians and lazily watched the familiar
landmarks as they passed. She had started early so that the journey
should be accomplished in day-light, and still they did not reach home.
She noted the various trees and hedges and was puzzled. Surely, the
road seemed different. The sun, a ball of golden fire, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e428" href="#xd20e428" name=
"xd20e428">14</a>]</span>sank to rest in a bed of many-tinted clouds,
and still they had not arrived. <i>Bow-ma</i> felt strangely
anxious.</p>
<p>The carriage suddenly swerved. To her dismay she saw they had turned
into a rough and untravelled road with paddy-fields on either side. The
place seemed lonely. It was now rapidly growing dark, for in India
after sun-set Night does not long delay her coming. A presentiment of
evil clutched <i>bow-ma&rsquo;s</i> heart. She whispered to her little
boy to ask the driver where they were and when they should arrive. In
India it is not permitted a woman to address any man save her husband,
father, and brothers.</p>
<p>The child obeyed but the driver made no reply. &ldquo;Ask
again,&rdquo; whispered the mother, &ldquo;he has not heard
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy asked, &ldquo;When shall we arrive?&rdquo; again and again,
but not a word answered the driver.</p>
<p><i>Bow-ma</i>, now thoroughly alarmed, beat the shutters of the
carriage and commanded her son to shout loudly. The boy screamed at the
top of his voice, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you reply? What road is
this?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e447" href="#xd20e447"
name="xd20e447">15</a>]</span></p>
<p>The driver now answered disrespectfully: &ldquo;You will soon know
where you are going,&rdquo; and laughed.</p>
<p>His rude gruff tone and evasive answer confirmed
<i>bow-ma&rsquo;s</i> worst fears. The awful word <i>dacoits</i> stood
out in her mind in letters of fire. Horror and dread filled her soul.
Drawing her child towards her, she hushed his eager questioning and
waited in silent anguish for the coming danger.</p>
<p>The carriage bumped and rattled over the uneven road. Presently it
stopped. It was now almost dark. The door was jerked open and a harsh
voice commanded: &ldquo;Get out of the carriage.&rdquo; <i>Bow-ma</i>
recognised the driver&rsquo;s voice and, realising the futility of
objecting, without a word she stepped down and helped her little son to
alight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me&rdquo; was the next rough order. Again she silently
obeyed. The man left the road and led her a little distance away under
the shadow of some trees. &ldquo;Take off your jewels. Give them to
me.&rdquo; A faint sigh of relief escaped her. Perhaps the jewels were
all he wanted. Quickly she unclasped her handsome necklet and gave it
him. He grasped it greedily with one hand and extended the other for
more. One by one she stripped her <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e465" href="#xd20e465" name="xd20e465">16</a>]</span>wrists and
arms of their lovely bracelets and bangles and handed them to him.
&ldquo;More&rdquo; he growled. She pulled the rings from her fingers
and added to them her ear and nose rings. &ldquo;Your waist
chain&rdquo; he snapped. She unclasped and dropped its golden weight
into those greedy hands. &ldquo;Take off your anklets, I want
all&rdquo; he sneered. She knelt on the ground to unclasp them. Then,
rising, handed them to him, wondering what more would follow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the child wept bitterly, and angrily forbade the driver to
take his mother&rsquo;s jewels, calling him robber and thief.
&ldquo;Yes, dacoit I am,&rdquo; the scoundrel replied to the
boy&rsquo;s revilings, &ldquo;and if you will not be quiet, I will
teach you how to.&rdquo; <i>Bow-ma</i> gently strove to console and
silence her son. &ldquo;Fret not! Your father will give me more and
better jewels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off your <i>saree</i>&rdquo; was the next outrageous
command. The boy&rsquo;s indignation flamed afresh. His mother took an
unguarded step forward and asked: &ldquo;Are not my jewels enough that
you want the <i>saree</i> off my back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, your <i>saree</i> and all you have. Silence your child
or I will kill him.&rdquo; Terrible was the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e485" href="#xd20e485" name=
"xd20e485">17</a>]</span>harsh voice in its determination.
<i>Bow-ma&rsquo;s</i> heart stood still. Entreaty would be of no avail.
She unwound the richly-embroidered silken folds from about her and cast
the gold and green <i>saree</i> at his feet: &ldquo;Take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have stripped my mother,&rdquo; screamed the boy. The
ruffian caught the <i>saree</i> with a fearful oath and turning on him
said: &ldquo;Now I can deal with you. I will fetch a brick from yonder
kiln and pound the breath out of you,&rdquo; With these words he strode
forward, tying the jewels in the <i>saree</i> as he went. Now her
sorely-tried nerves gave way, and, distracted with grief, <i>bow-ma</i>
caught her child in her arms, and their mingled cries rent the air. But
the thief did not return.</p>
<p>About midnight a village policeman going his rounds heard their
cries. At first he paid no heed to them: jackals swarmed and disturbed
the night. Again the anguished voices quivered in the air. There was
something human in the sound. He stopped to listen. The cries rose
again. He walked forward in their direction. Clearer, as he advanced,
shrilled the distressed voices, and he recognised they were those of a
woman and a child. He quickened his steps and hastened to the spot.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e506" href="#xd20e506" name=
"xd20e506">18</a>]</span>The light from his lantern revealed
<i>bow-ma</i> and her son, clinging to each other and weeping
piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you? What ails you?&rdquo; he asked. The distraught
mother, unconscious of the flight of time, thinking him the heartless
dacoit returned to kill her boy, fell at his feet in an agony of
supplication: &ldquo;Spare my son. Take my life instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a <i>chowkidar</i> (watchman). What is up?&rdquo; But so
dulled were her ears with fear and grief that he was twice obliged to
repeat his words. When the joyful intelligence reached her brain she
burst into tears. &ldquo;O! save my son.&rdquo; Then the consciousness
that the danger was past reminded her of her own plight, and she
sobbed: &ldquo;Give me something to wear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policeman had noticed her semi-nude state. Dropping, his
<i>pugree</i> at her feet he turned away. She shook out its many folds
and draped it about her body. Then she related what had befallen her
and pointed towards the direction the thief had taken.</p>
<p>The policeman walked cautiously forward, his lantern raised in one
hand and his <i>lathi</i> tightly <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e529" href="#xd20e529" name="xd20e529">19</a>]</span>grasped in
the other. A few yards ahead he came to an old brick kiln. Here, prone
among the broken bricks, lay the robber in greater straits than his
victims. A huge cobra was tightly coiled round his right arm, while on
the left hung the <i>saree</i> and the jewels. The rays of the lantern
disturbed the snake. With an angry hiss it uncoiled itself and
disappeared. The dacoit, more dead than alive from simple fear of the
snake&rsquo;s fatal sting, yielded himself a prisoner, and it was
subsequently discovered that the whole gang, of whom he was a member,
were licensed hackney drivers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e534"

<h2>Saved by a Bear</h2>
<p>The evening shadows and silence had settled on the river Hooghly as
an old Brahman wended his way to one of the many <i>ghats</i> (landing
places).</p>
<p>The <i>dinghis</i>&mdash;little boats which ply backwards and
forwards all day carrying passengers to and from Calcutta&mdash;had all
been made fast for the night. Some of the boatmen were cooking their
evening meal, while others sat about on the decks smoking and singing.
Many of the boats were wedged close together and drawn up on to the
bank.</p>
<p>But one lay well in the water and some distance from its
fellow-craft. Its <i>manjhi</i> (headman) stood on the stern deck,
binding together the mat roof of his boat. His seemingly careless gaze
took in the Brahman, about to descend the bank. He noted that the old
man carried a parcel, partially concealed in his <i>chadar</i> (scarf),
and, from the manner in which he hugged it, the observer concluded it
contained something valuable. As the Brahman came nearer, the
<i>manjhi</i> saw it was a bag of money.</p>
<p>The old man picked his way down the bank and called upon boat after
boat to take him to a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e561" href=
"#xd20e561" name="xd20e561">21</a>]</span>small village near Serampore,
for in those days there was no railway. None were willing to go so far.
Meanwhile a whispered consultation had taken place between the
<i>manjhi</i> and <i>dhars</i> (oarsmen) of the furthest <i>dinghi</i>.
When the Brahman finally accosted them, they first demurred and then,
as though still reluctant, consented to hire their boat.</p>
<p>Just as they were pushing off, a man with a performing bear ran down
the bank. &ldquo;Where goest thou?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serampore&rdquo; answered the Brahman before the boatman
could reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My home is near by,&rdquo; the man remarked gladly, and
jumped into the boat, pulling his bear after him.</p>
<p>The boatmen scowled angrily: &ldquo;Get out, we go not so
far.&rdquo; But he would not. The <i>manjhi</i> warned him that he and
his bear would gain nothing by forcing themselves into the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These boatmen are queer customers,&rdquo; he laughingly
remarked to the Brahman, and to them: &ldquo;Gain nothing! Why! I will
reach my home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you say,&rdquo; they answered. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e587" href="#xd20e587" name=
"xd20e587">22</a>]</span></p>
<p>The bear-man wondered within himself at their unwillingness to have
him as a passenger. He and the old Brahman made a few remarks to each
other. Then they fell silent.</p>
<p>They were near the end of their journey when the bear-man asked
suddenly: &ldquo;<i>Manjhi</i>, have we not passed
Serampore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the <i>guru</i> of boatmen that you question
me?&rdquo; replied the <i>manjhi</i>, and then, in a more conciliatory
tone, added: &ldquo;We are going higher up for a crossing. The tide is
strong.&rdquo; The explanation was reasonable. But the bear-man&rsquo;s
suspicions had been awakened and he was on the alert. The Brahman sat
placidly nursing his bag which the bear-man too had noticed contained
money. He had also noticed that the <i>manjhis</i> kept glancing
furtively at it and its owner.</p>
<p>The river crossed, the boat hugged the bank; after a time it came to
a standstill. One of the <i>manjhis</i> jumped ashore with the rope and
secured it to a tree. The Brahman and the bear-man both asked:
&ldquo;What is wrong? Why stop the boat in this strange
place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will soon know, you will soon see,&rdquo; answered the
boatmen and chuckled over some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e614"
href="#xd20e614" name="xd20e614">23</a>]</span>secret joke as, one
after another, each stepped ashore and disappeared.</p>
<p>The aged Brahman gazed after them apprehensively. Then, placing his
money between his knees, as he sat on the deck with crossed legs tucked
under him, he folded his hands together and bent forward in prayer.</p>
<p>The bear-man thought within himself: &ldquo;Prayer for him, action
for me.&rdquo; And saying softly to the old man; <i>&ldquo;Brahman
Thakoor</i>, something is brewing. I follow to see,&rdquo; he too
stepped ashore.</p>
<p>Not far from the tree he found a small thatched house and several
men gathered behind it. Moving warily forward among the group he
recognised the <i>manjhis.</i> &ldquo;Dacoits!&rdquo; he whispered to
himself. Then an inspiration struck him.</p>
<p>He ran back to the boat, and asked the Brahman to change his seat to
the stern and be ready to steer off when he gave him a signal. He took
up a position in the prow and fondled his bear.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes a party of men appeared coming towards the
<i>dinghi</i>. Some were boatmen; all were dacoits.</p>
<p>The actor loosed the bear&rsquo;s chain, saying: &ldquo;Go! go! hug
the life out of all of them!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e637" href="#xd20e637" name="xd20e637">24</a>]</span></p>
<p>The sagacious animal responded to his master&rsquo;s order with a
fierce charge right among the approaching band of robbers. With
startled cries they fled in all directions. Quite sure they were
effectively scattered, the bear-man called his animal back, secured its
chain once more, and pushed from the shore.</p>
<p>With some difficulty he and the old Brahman navigated themselves
back to Calcutta and informed the police authorities there. The police
took possession of the <i>dinghi</i> which on inspection proved to be a
dacoit&rsquo;s nest well-equipped with instruments fitted for murder
and robbery. But none of this gang of river dacoits were captured.</p>
<p>The lives of the Brahman and the showman were certainly saved by the
wonderful intelligence of the latter&rsquo;s bear. <span class=

<h2>Raghu Dacoit</h2>
<p>Madhub Babu, a Calcutta gentleman, owned much property in that city
and was known far and wide on account of his great wealth. To do him
honour, the City Fathers had named a tank after him.</p>
<p>At that time there flourished a notorious dacoit, Raghu, for whose
capture Government had offered a handsome reward. But like Robin Hood
of old, Raghu Dacoit had caught popular fancy by his generosity to the
poor. Though he looted the rich, to the needy, the famine-stricken and
widows he was always kind. No one would inform against him.</p>
<p>Madhub Babu had a fine country house in Chandernagore, where he
frequently entertained his friends. On one of these occasions, the
latest doings of Raghu Dacoit were being discussed. The Babu remarked
confidently: &ldquo;He dare not visit me. He knows my house is well
guarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the guests quickly rejoined: &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that.
Raghu Dacoit is a dangerous and clever man.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e660" href="#xd20e660" name=
"xd20e660">26</a>]</span></p>
<p>A few days after, Madhub Babu received a letter from the famous
outlaw saying that he would be pleased to visit the rich man&rsquo;s
country house. Madhub Babu was amazed at the audacity of the fellow,
and wondered how his remark had reached the robber&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>He immediately sent information to Calcutta and asked for a strong
body of police to be sent at his expense. They arrived, and his country
residence was extra well guarded for some time. But nothing happened!
Madhub Babu concluded that the letter had been a hoax. So the police
guard was withdrawn.</p>
<p>Madhub Babu&rsquo;s Chandernagore house stood on the bank of the
river. One dark night a boat came quietly to the <i>ghat</i>. Its
occupants silently landed and proceeded stealthily to the house. Every
door and window was securely fastened, but what mattered that to Raghu
and his band? Tall trees graced the grounds everywhere and many grew
near the house. Climbing the nearest, some of the dacoits reached up a
long and stout bamboo from it to the flat roof. A slim youth crawled
over and fixed the other end securely. Then one by one some of the gang
slid across. The door of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e670"
href="#xd20e670" name="xd20e670">27</a>]</span>staircase leading down
into the house stood open. Creeping like cats downstairs they gained
the entrance hall. Here they found all the <i>durwans</i> fast asleep.
The light of their lanterns showed the <i>durwans&rsquo;</i> swords
hanging on the wall. In a trice the dacoits had them down, unsheathed,
and, oh, bitter blow! despatched Madhub Babu&rsquo;s men with their own
weapons.</p>
<p>Then noiselessly opening the door they admitted the remainder of the
band. For a few hours there was uproar, confusion and dismay while the
burglars invaded room after room and collected all Madhub Babu&rsquo;s
treasures with which they disappeared.</p>
<p>While still smarting under the loss of his valuables, the Babu
received another letter from Raghu Dacoit asking, &ldquo;Had his visit
given Madhub Babu pleasure?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2>Girl as Kali-Ma</h2>
<p>A large and well-to-do family lived happily in a country place in
Bengal.</p>
<p>One day their peace was disturbed by an anonymous letter. The writer
warned them to expect a &ldquo;dacoity&rdquo; (burglary). These Indian
outlaws always make it a point of honour to inform their intended
victims, and always come with drums, torch-light and a sort of
war-cry.</p>
<p>There was much valuable jewellery in the house and the family,
thinking discretion the better part of valour, gathered all together,
packed it securely and, taking it with them, left their home about
sunset for safe quarters.</p>
<p>Somehow one of the younger ladies with a tiny infant was left
behind. Unaware of the warning letter or desertion of the family, she
slept peacefully through the early hours of the night. But later, she
was awakened by the sound of drums and loud cries, which she recognised
as the signal of the dacoits. Rushing out of her chamber she discovered
that the burglars were already in the house and that none of the family
were to be found. From <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e694" href=
"#xd20e694" name="xd20e694">29</a>]</span>room to room she fled,
finding none to protect her, and realised that she was alone and
helpless. Even her husband was gone!</p>
<p>She was a high-spirited and resourceful girl. She knew her life and
the baby&rsquo;s as well were in danger and she determined to outwit
the burglars. She had a swarthy complexion like Kali, the
dacoits&rsquo; divinity. Often had her mother bemoaned its darkness!
Now it should serve her. But was she black enough? To make assurance
doubly sure, she caught up a bottle of ink, which she knew where to
find, and hastily smeared her face and limbs with it. Then, hiding her
baby in a safe corner, she uncoiled her heavy hair and let its
luxuriant black tresses fall about her like a cloak. Her preparations
complete, she placed herself in a large niche at the head of the
stairs.</p>
<p>The dacoits found nothing below worth attention and trooped
upstairs. The flickering glare of their torches fell upon a life-like
image of Kali the Terrible. With protruding scarlet tongue and fixed
staring eyes, the girl stood immovable and breathless, silently
invoking all her family gods to come to her aid in her bold design.</p>
<p>With an awe-struck cry of &ldquo;Mercy! mercy! <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e702" href="#xd20e702" name=
"xd20e702">30</a>]</span>Kali-Ma!&rdquo;, the thieves fell prostrate at
her feet. The girl held her breath. Was it possible that her plan had
succeeded? The slow seconds passed. The Chief arose. &ldquo;Come,
brothers, we touch nothing where Mother Kali is worshipped.&rdquo; With
hasty and reverent steps they descended the stairs and left the
house.</p>
<p>Long after the dacoits had gone the girl stood there. Then the
strain snapped and she relapsed to her normal self. Fear swept over her
and she rushed out of the house. But her trembling limbs could not
carry her far. She fell in a dead faint on the pathway. The neighbours,
who had heard the dacoits enter the house and seen them go away silent
and empty-handed, came to learn the mystery and found her there.</p>
<p>When the family returned next morning, the neighbours abused them
soundly for leaving the girl and her babe behind. The girl herself was
so hurt by the neglect that she had scarcely strength enough to relate
the strange happenings of the night. Her husband found it difficult to
make his peace; he said that he believed her to be with the ladies of
the family. In zenana families even the most devoted husband has little
voice in his wife&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e708" href=
"#xd20e708" name="xd20e708">31</a>]</span>movements, as all
arrangements are left in the hands of the mother-in-law. There were
several ladies and children in the family and the mother-in-law had
thought the girl was with some of them. Friendship was however finally
restored. All generously admired her ingenuity and realised her
bravery. From the white-haired old father to the smallest child,
everyone was grateful then and always after for her presence of mind on
that memorable night. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e710" href=

<h2>The Deputy Magistrate</h2>
<p>In the Dacca district, a few years ago, there was a big dacoity. A
Deputy Magistrate was ordered to secretly investigate the matter and,
if possible, to capture the miscreants.</p>
<p>Besides his cook and personal attendants he took with him some
policemen. All were disguised. They travelled in several small
boats.</p>
<p>It was late in the evening as they neared the place, where the
burglary had occurred. He decided to proceed no further that night. The
boats put to; the men cooked their evening meal and all retired.</p>
<p>About midnight, the Magistrate awoke with a start to hear many
voices calling him by name. He listened: &ldquo;So you have come to
arrest us, to put us in jail, to hang us. Ah! you will soon see who
will be punished. We shall know how clever you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night was pitch-dark. He noiselessly opened the small window of
the boat and saw a number of men, with flaming torches in their hands
and armed with heavy sticks, coming down the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e724" href="#xd20e724" name=
"xd20e724">33</a>]</span>bank. There was no time to call his men. He
seized his loaded revolver. But what was one against so many! He
decided to bolt. The land way was barred by the dacoits. What of the
river? He was a good swimmer. But the water looked black as ink and
swarmed with crocodiles. Yet to stay in the boat meant certain death.
If he gained the opposite bank, he could make for his
father-in-law&rsquo;s house, which was near the river and where his
wife was then staying. He might escape the crocodiles. He determined to
risk it.</p>
<p>Like a flash all this passed through his mind. Opening the other
window he clambered out stealthily and slipped into the water. A few
powerful strokes carried him across. He stumbled up the bank and raced
through the thorny jungle to his father-in-law&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>The sleeping family were disturbed by his violent knocking. As soon
as he was admitted, he went to his wife&rsquo;s room. She was horrified
to hear of his danger. After a hasty bath and change she insisted that
he should eat something, and while he was refreshing himself, she
informed her father of his son-in-law&rsquo;s escape and predicament.
To her surprise, her father said: &ldquo;I am sorry, but he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e730" href="#xd20e730" name=
"xd20e730">34</a>]</span>must leave my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O! father, how can he?&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He must</i>&rdquo; repeated her father.</p>
<p>The daughter fell at her parent&rsquo;s feet and implored him not to
drive her husband forth. But no words of hers could move him.
&ldquo;Why should all suffer for one?&rdquo; he argued. She returned
sadly to her husband.</p>
<p>Presently the cries of the dacoits showed that they had scented
their quarry. Soon they shouted at the door: &ldquo;Open! or drive out
the Deputy Magistrate. We know he is here. Give him to us or what
happens be on your own head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wife wept piteously. Her father remained obdurate, muttering,
&ldquo;I knew this would happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unfortunate Magistrate could not understand his
father-in-law&rsquo;s behaviour. He sat with his head bowed in despair.
Suddenly his wife ran to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must try to escape. I have an idea.&rdquo; She pulled out
a <i>saree</i> and some jewels, and began to dress him as a woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; he said hopelessly, &ldquo;they
will catch me.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e755" href=
"#xd20e755" name="xd20e755">35</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Be brave,&rdquo; she said encouragingly, &ldquo;for my sake
see if you cannot elude them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With tender hands she arranged the <i>saree</i>, draping it well
over his head to conceal his face. Then giving him a <i>ghurra</i>
(water vessel) told him to pretend that he was going to fetch water
from the river. Cheered by her courage, he caught her to his heart in a
mute farewell, and her prayers went with him.</p>
<p>He had not gone far from the house when cries arose of &ldquo;There
he is!&rdquo; But some one shouted: &ldquo;It is a woman. Look
elsewhere.&rdquo; And he passed slowly to the river. Here he flung the
brass <i>ghurra</i> far out into the stream and ran for his life along
the bank. No sounds of pursuit followed him, and he now gained courage
enough to form a plan of escape. Not far from his father-in-law&rsquo;s
village was a small police station. Thither he bent his steps and asked
protection of its solitary occupant.</p>
<p>The man recognised him and asked: &ldquo;Deputy Saheb, why are you
here? What is wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Magistrate told him of the dacoits and of his escape.
&ldquo;Dacoits after you!&rdquo; said the policeman and looked grave.
&ldquo;Sir, I cannot help you. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e775"
href="#xd20e775" name="xd20e775">36</a>]</span>What is one
<i>policewallah</i> against so many? If I shelter you we shall both
die. You better push on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time the Magistrate pleaded to deaf ears. But at length his
promises of promotion and reward moved the man. &ldquo;Come&rdquo; he
said &ldquo;I will do my best,&rdquo; and, rising, led the way to his
own house. Here in the inner room was a high <i>machan</i>&mdash;a huge
bamboo shelf made like a raft and suspended from the roof and reached
by a moveable ladder, used for storing all sorts of things.</p>
<p>On this <i>machan</i> were some old blankets. &ldquo;Here, conceal
yourself in these&rdquo; said the policeman. The Deputy Magistrate
needed no second bidding. He climbed up and rolled himself in one of
the blankets and heaped the others in front of him. The policeman
carried the ladder away, right out of the house. Then he shut the door
and returned to the office.</p>
<p>After a time there came the noise of the dacoits. They soon entered
the police station and shouted: &ldquo;Give up that Deputy Saheb. We
know he is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deputy, what Deputy? I cannot understand. Where is he?&rdquo;
answered the policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be shamming,&rdquo; returned the dacoits
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e797" href="#xd20e797" name=
"xd20e797">37</a>]</span>contemptuously, &ldquo;thou knowest well whom
we mean. Produce him if you value your own life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In vain the policeman pleaded ignorance. His trembling limbs and
shaking voice belied his words. The dacoits bound him, searched the
police office, and then proceeded to hunt the house. &ldquo;He is not
here. Let us not waste further time,&rdquo; said one.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look well,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;and search
every place.&rdquo; Some climbed the <i>machan</i> and discovered their
victim. It did not take them long to drag him down, and beat him
mercilessly with their long sticks, till he became unconscious. The
policeman too was severely chastised. Him they left lying there; but
rolled the offending Magistrate in an old mat, bound him tightly with a
rope and carried him away to the river.</p>
<p>As he was borne on their shoulders through the night air, he
gradually came to his senses but kept silent and listened to his
captors. By this time it was dawn, and they were at the river. The
majority were for re-crossing and burning him, dead or alive. One
dissentient voice struck him with surprise. It was his
father-in-law&rsquo;s! Clearly he was one of the gang! But scruples had
overtaken him and he pleaded that he might not be a witness
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e806" href="#xd20e806" name=
"xd20e806">38</a>]</span>of the projected murder of his son-in-law.
&ldquo;Spare me! spare me!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Some jeered: &ldquo;Ho! Ho! you still have a soft corner in your
heart for your son-in-law.&rdquo; At last they agreed that he might
absent himself and he apparently turned back.</p>
<p>The others now put their burden into a boat and crossed the river.
They were laughing at the father-in-law&rsquo;s weakness, and as they
approached the <i>ghat</i> failed to observe a Government
<i>budgerow</i> anchored there. It was the Divisional
Commissioner&rsquo;s. He was out on tour. The <i>paharawalla</i> on
deck checked them: &ldquo;Do not make such a noise. The Saheb
sleeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They answered rudely and the watchman retorted angrily. The dacoits
loudly abused the man.</p>
<p>The noise woke up the Commissioner, and he got out on deck with a
loaded revolver in his hand. The dacoits jumped from their
<i>dinghy</i> and ran up the bank. It was evident who they were and the
Commissioner fired, aiming at their legs. One man fell with a scream of
pain but scrambled to his feet and ran on.</p>
<p>Nothing was to be gained by chasing them <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e830" href="#xd20e830" name=
"xd20e830">39</a>]</span>through the still dark jungle. The
Commissioner turned his attention to the boat. &ldquo;Search it&rdquo;
he ordered his watchmen. His quick eyes detected legs protruding from a
mat, and he was not surprised when his <i>chaprassi</i> called:
&ldquo;Saheb, a dead man lies in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Deputy murmured feebly: &ldquo;I am not dead. I live.&rdquo; The
<i>chaprassi</i> amended the first statement: &ldquo;Saheb, he
speaks.&rdquo; The Commissioner jumped into the <i>dinghi</i>, cut the
ropes that bound the unfortunate man, and discovered the Deputy
Magistrate. It did not take him long to recover and pour his tale of
woe into his Chief&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>By sunrise they were all after the dacoits. Blood-drops marked the
way and, near by, they found the wounded man who, only able to hobble,
had hidden himself in a thicket. The Deputy Magistrate&rsquo;s
father-in-law was arrested. He was one of the leaders of the band. It
did not take long to capture the others. And after this, for a time,
this part of the Dacca district enjoyed peace from dacoits.

<h2>All for Nothing</h2>
<p>A young and very high-caste Bengali lady was married to the son of a
rich man who lived near Hooghly, a small town within a short distance
of Calcutta.</p>
<p>Some years passed, but there was no sign of a son and heir. The
parents-in-law were fond of the girl. She had won her way into their
hearts and they sympathised with her. Yet they longed to see the old
name being carried down the years, and whisperings grew into talk of a
second marriage for their son. The girl&rsquo;s parents were anxious
and distressed.</p>
<p>Then a kindly Providence intervened, and after months of expectation
a little son lay in her arms, and both families rejoiced with the girl
and shared her pride in the boy baby.</p>
<p>When the child was about a year old, the young mother&rsquo;s
brother became engaged to be married. The date was fixed and
invitations sent to the girl and to the family of her parents-in-law.
It was arranged that she and her baby should attend the wedding.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e858" href="#xd20e858" name=
"xd20e858">41</a>]</span></p>
<p>Not far off, also in Hooghly, lived a widowed sister (of the girl)
in her father-in-law&rsquo;s house. She too was going to the wedding,
and it was settled that both sisters should travel in the same boat to
Calcutta. No male member of either family could accompany them.
Therefore, their father sent an old servant from Calcutta to fetch
them. This man was trusted and treated like a member of the family,
with whom he had been for years.</p>
<p>The girl put together her clothes. Her good mother-in-law unlocked
the great safe and took out the girl&rsquo;s best jewels. An Indian
wedding is the occasion for a great display of clothes and jewellery,
and a well-dressed and richly-adorned <i>bow</i> raises the credit of
the mother-in-law, especially if the wedding is in the girl&rsquo;s own
family; so a careful selection was made. Baby was not forgotten either.
Tiny gold bangles and chains had been showered upon him at his birth,
and this was his first public appearance.</p>
<p>They started early, so as to arrive during the afternoon. There was
to be a ceremony the next day and many guests had arrived at the
bride-groom&rsquo;s house, and all watched eagerly for the two sisters.
But the hours waned and still they tarried. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e868" href="#xd20e868" name=
"xd20e868">42</a>]</span>Late in the evening, the old servant arrived,
agitated and all mud-bespattered.</p>
<p>Family, guests and servants plied him with questions concerning the
sisters. Not a word would he reply. Suspicions soon voiced themselves.
Dacoits were about. Everyone knew of the wedding and the consequent
family gathering. Everyone knew too that the daughter was the cherished
<i>bow</i> of a rich family.</p>
<p>Urged by these arguments and his own anxiety, the father threatened
to skin the man alive unless he spoke. Intimidated by his
master&rsquo;s anger, the servant stated that the boat had capsized and
the sisters and baby were drowned.</p>
<p>The house of mirth and laughter was changed to one of weeping. But
the father did not accept the information in its entirety. He called in
the police and a vigorous search was made. All the boatmen were found.
They stated they had swum ashore but could or would give no word of the
ladies.</p>
<p>The only possible clue was given by an Englishman living in a mill
on the river bank at Chinsurah. About midnight, on the date of the
disappearance of the ladies, he heard the cries of women and a child.
At first he had thought of going to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e882" href="#xd20e882" name="xd20e882">43</a>]</span>see what was
up. But the sounds were coming from a thick jungle, and he argued it
was impossible any one could be there in trouble, and finally thought
no more of the seeming cries.</p>
<p>This ill-omened happening broke up the wedding party. The marriage
was cancelled. All the preparations had been for nothing. To this day
the fate of the sisters is unknown. The bride and bridegroom-elect were
married to other parties. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e886" href=

<h2>A Punjabee Dacoit</h2>
<p>In a railway train several Punjabee ladies sat on the lower berths
of a second class compartment, laughing and talking gaily. They were,
with one exception, all richly dressed and each of them wore a quantity
of jewels. The exception was a capable, good-looking woman, of about
twenty-five. Her short hair, neck and arms bare of jewellery, and plain
white <i>saree</i>, proclaimed her a widow. But like the others she
chatted merrily, and a listener would have learned from their
conversation that they had been attending a wedding, and were now on
their way home. Witty remarks about the guests, criticism of the looks
of the bride, and comparisons of this wedding with others, passed from
one to another, and whiled away the hours of the journey as the train
sped onwards.</p>
<p>Night fell, and the ladies became silent. They rested against each
other and dozed at intervals. The widow sat on a trunk at the end of
the carriage and silently told her beads. The train slowed down and
stopped at a little station. Then the bell clanged and once again they
were on their way. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e897" href=
"#xd20e897" name="xd20e897">45</a>]</span>The little station had not
been left far behind when a dark figure appeared on the foot-board of
the ladies&rsquo; carriage, and a man&rsquo;s head was thrust in at one
of the windows. A startled exclamation from one of the party drew the
attention of all to the intruder, who was pulling himself up into the
carriage. He was very fierce-looking, wore a huge turban, and had a
bushy black beard. In one hand he held a knife and with the other he
assisted himself into the compartment, in spite of the ladies&rsquo;
protestations.</p>
<p>Some of them began to cry but one or two bolder spirits ventured to
argue with him. In answer to their questions and objections, he said
roughly: &ldquo;It is a long while before you will reach another
station. I have come for your jewels. If you give them to me quietly, I
will not hurt any of you; but if not&mdash;&rdquo; and he looked very
expressively at the knife in his hand.</p>
<p>After some few minutes, the ladies, who were inclined to oppose him,
yielded to the tearful advice of their more timid sisters, and one by
one they began to unclasp necklaces and belts and hand them over to the
dacoit together with bracelets, bangles and rings. The ruffian, finding
them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e903" href="#xd20e903" name=
"xd20e903">46</a>]</span>docile, did not hustle them in any way but
stood leisurely receiving the spoil. Then he carefully folded all in a
rich <i>saree</i> and was knotting the ends together when the train
suddenly stopped, and an Englishman pushed open the door of the
ladies&rsquo; compartment and sprang at him with the exclamation,
&ldquo;You scoundrel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sudden surprise and assault threw the robber off his feet, and
he fell sprawling on the carriage floor, with the Englishman on top of
him. In the meantime, the guard and others arrived and the thief was
secured and his hands and feet were bound together with his own
<i>pugree</i>, and he was removed to the guard&rsquo;s van.</p>
<p>The widow was the heroine of the adventure. As soon as she saw the
man entering the carriage, she realised his purpose. Slipping into the
lavatory she climbed through the window there on to the footboard, and
pulled herself along by the carriage rods to the next compartment where
the solitary occupant, an Englishman, sat reading.</p>
<p>He was amazed to see a woman clinging to the window of his carriage,
but fortunately he understood the language; and when she said
&ldquo;Help, thief in the next carriage&rdquo;, he opened the door and
got <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e917" href="#xd20e917" name=
"xd20e917">47</a>]</span>her into his carriage without any delay. In a
few words, she acquainted him with what was happening in the next
compartment. He immediately pulled the alarm cord to stop the train,
and hurried along the footboard to the assistance of the ladies. They
were profuse in their expressions of gratitude to him, but he insisted
that they owed their lives and their jewels to their courageous friend.

<h2>A Child&rsquo;s Experience</h2>
<p>Some years ago in a country place, not far from Calcutta, there
lived a well-to-do Bengalee gentleman. He was an old man; and his large
family consisting of sons, grandsons, and his brothers with their wives
and children, and many dependent relatives&mdash;all lived happily
together in their ancestral home.</p>
<p>It was an old-fashioned house with verandahs, courtyards and many
rooms. In a large <i>dalan</i> or verandah all the family <i>poojas</i>
were celebrated. Here the daughters of the house were married, and for
generations the old walls had looked on at family gatherings and
festivities.</p>
<p>There were extensive grounds round the house. Quite close to the
<i>zenana</i> there was a large kitchen garden which supplied all the
vegetables consumed daily in the house; and so plentiful was the
produce that large trays filled with vegetables were sent out every day
as presents to friends, relatives and to the neighbouring temples.</p>
<p>A little further away was an orchard, and in spring the numerous
mango trees delighted all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e940" href=
"#xd20e940" name="xd20e940">49</a>]</span>eyes with their blossoms. And
there were jack fruit trees, peaches, plums and guava trees in numbers,
besides long lines of plantains and palms of several kinds.</p>
<p>In the garden, orchard and stables there were tanks and wells so
that the supply of water was sufficient for the needs of such a large
establishment. In front of the mansion there was a large ornamental
tank or lake with white marble steps leading to its waters. Here every
evening the men and boys of the family gathered to recreate and enjoy
the cooling south breeze, and they were often joined by neighbours, and
many a pleasant hour was spent on those marble steps.</p>
<p>An avenue of trees and a high hedge rendered the house quite
private, and the roof was a lovely recreation place and promenade for
the ladles and girls of the family, who were all <i>purdah</i>.</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s wealth was much discussed and the expensive
clothes and rich jewels of the ladies were often spoken of. One day the
old gentleman received a warning letter from a band of dacoits that the
house would be visited by them that night. After some hurried
consultation, the family packed up all their jewels and valuables and
sought shelter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e951" href="#xd20e951"
name="xd20e951">50</a>]</span>in flight. It was decided to spend the
night at a place a few miles distant.</p>
<p>In the excitement a young mother was separated from her little boy,
a child of about three or four years of age. She concluded that he was
with some other member of the family in another carriage and did not
trouble herself about it. But on their arrival at their place of refuge
he was not found with any of the others.</p>
<p>The mother&rsquo;s distress of mind was pitiful. She wished to
return for her child; but it was growing dark and there was the danger
of meeting the dacoits. So her wish was overruled, and through the long
night she suffered terrible anxiety, picturing in her mind all that was
perhaps befalling her little son.</p>
<p>In the meantime the child was sleeping sweetly and peacefully in his
bed in his mother&rsquo;s room. Tired out with play, he had slipped
into bed unknown to any one and there he lay.</p>
<p>About twelve at night the dacoits arrived and broke into the house.
They searched the empty rooms and were furious at finding no valuables
worth carrying away. They came to the room where the little boy slept,
and their loud voices <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e962" href=
"#xd20e962" name="xd20e962">51</a>]</span>awakened him. He sat up and,
seeing their strange faces and glaring torches, screamed with fright.
One of them threatened to kill him if he did not stop his noise.
Another stepped to the bedside and taking the little boy in his arms
said: &ldquo;Little one, do not cry. No one will hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child recognised his father&rsquo;s servant and twined his
little arms around the man&rsquo;s neck. The other dacoits laughed and
walked out of the room leaving their comrade with the child.</p>
<p>When daylight broke, the family returned home, and the poor young
mother flew through the house in search of her child. To her surprise
and joy she found him sleeping peacefully in her own room. Her
hysterical caresses awakened him and the little fellow could not
understand what ailed his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did nothing happen during the night?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;Did you see anything or anyone, my son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rubbing his chubby knuckles in his eyes the sleepy little boy
answered: &ldquo;Oh, yes, where were you, mother? A lot of men came.
Some wanted to hit me, but&mdash;(naming the servant) was with them,
and he sent them away. Then he gave me sweets and put me to
sleep.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e972" href="#xd20e972"
name="xd20e972">52</a>]</span></p>
<p>The servant was arrested, and he confessed that he was one of the
band of dacoits who had sent the warning letter and had broken into the
house. Nearly the whole band was captured. <span class=

<h2>Two Chinese Dacoits</h2>
<p>In a large house in Calcutta there lived an Englishman, his wife and
her sister. Mrs. C. was of a highly-strung and nervous disposition, and
as her husband&rsquo;s business frequently occasioned his absence from
home, they had persuaded her sister Ethel to come out to India on a
long visit.</p>
<p>Ethel was a bright, lively girl, very practical and quite the
opposite of her sister, whom she often rallied for her timidity. Once
when Alice was more trying than usual, Ethel exclaimed: &ldquo;Perhaps
if I were a little like you, Alice, delicate, nervous and silly, I
might get a husband who would fuss over me like Charlie does over
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alice laughed at her sister&rsquo;s earnestness and said: &ldquo;If
you were not healthy and strong-minded you would understand me better,
Ethel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not long afterwards the two ladies were left alone for some days as
Mr. C. was obliged to go upcountry on business. While he was away,
Ethel slept with her sister. It was the cold weather when night closes
in early and the evenings are long. Mrs. C. liked an early dinner, soon
after which she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e988" href=
"#xd20e988" name="xd20e988">54</a>]</span>always retired. Ethel liked
to spend the long quiet evenings, reading or writing, and often sat up
till midnight.</p>
<p>One afternoon, while they were at lunch, a telegram was brought in,
and on opening it, Alice exclaimed delightedly &ldquo;Charlie will be
back in time for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evening passed away till dinner time but Mr. C. did not arrive
and the ladies waited till nine o&rsquo;clock. Then they dined, and
when the clock struck ten and still there was no arrival, Alice said
she would go to bed, as Charlie must have missed his train and the next
was not due till near midnight.</p>
<p>Ethel looked up from her book and said: &ldquo;Well, I am sleeping
in my own room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O! you know I hate to be alone,&rdquo; exclaimed Alice;
&ldquo;you might come and sleep in mine until Charlie comes
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alice, you are selfish,&rdquo; retorted Ethel. &ldquo;I shall
barely be in bed before he walks in. The only thing for me is to go to
bed in your room in my evening dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How silly you are,&rdquo; said Alice peevishly; &ldquo;why
cannot you undress as usual? Charlie may not come at all to-night and I
dread being alone.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1002"
href="#xd20e1002" name="xd20e1002">55</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;I will come and read
in your room till Charlie does come. I shall never marry a man who is
always away on business,&rdquo; With these words she forsook her easy
chair and accompanied her sister into the large bed-room. She threw
herself on the side of the bed and went on with her book.</p>
<p>Alice undressed, got into bed and was soon asleep. Ethel finished
her book and then lay waiting for her brother-in-law. The lights in the
hall and on the landing were not extinguished, but the house was still
and quiet. It was near twelve and Alice was just wondering if Mr. C.
would really arrive or if it would not be better for her to undress and
get into bed comfortably when she heard gentle footsteps on the
stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Charlie,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;and
how softly he is coming upstairs! he is a considerate
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at her sister, saw that she was sleeping very soundly.
&ldquo;I will pretend to be asleep too,&rdquo; said Ethel to herself
and she drew up the bed-clothes to hide her evening dress and put a
pillow over her head.</p>
<p>To her disappointment, Charlie delayed his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1014" href="#xd20e1014" name=
"xd20e1014">56</a>]</span>coming and she was wondering if he was dining
when the door slowly opened, but instead of Mr. C. two Chinamen entered
the room. Ethel stared at them from under her pillow with amazement. At
first they stood motionless beside the door. Then, closing it
noiselessly, they advanced into the room. Their quaint clothes, long
pigtails and red eyes together with their stealthy movements and the
hour of midnight, created an uncanny atmosphere in the room, and for
the first time in her life Ethel began to understand what nerves mean.
Never in her life had her pulses jumped and throbbed as they were doing
now. She controlled her inclination to scream and from under her pillow
watched the men.</p>
<p>They examined the room and one of them approached the toilette table
and began to transfer the jewels and silver ornaments which lay upon it
to a capacious bag. The other took a big cigar out of his pocket and
lit it. Then he stepped to Mrs. C.&rsquo;s side and began to puff the
smoke into her face. She was sleeping upon her back and though she at
first stirred uneasily she soon seemed to sink into a deeper sleep.
After a few minutes by her side, the Chinaman moved round to
Ethel&rsquo;s side of the bed; but seeing that her head was covered by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1018" href="#xd20e1018" name=
"xd20e1018">57</a>]</span>a pillow and that she was apparently fast
asleep, he turned to help his comrade.</p>
<p>At this moment Mr. C.&rsquo;s voice sounded in the hall and he came
running upstairs, whistling gaily. The robbers exchanged alarmed looks
and hastily hid themselves and their bag of booty behind a large
almirah. Charlie opened the door and came into the room, saying
&ldquo;Alice, where are you?&rdquo; Approaching the bed he said
&ldquo;What, asleep!&rdquo; and bent over his wife. But she was in a
deep slumber and oblivious of her husband&rsquo;s presence. He noticed
Ethel&rsquo;s form on the opposite side of the bed and, walking gently
round, touched her arm and whispered: &ldquo;Are you asleep
too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted the pillow, stretched her arms, and then sat up on the
bed. He noticed her evening dress and was explaining his late arrival
when she jumped up crossly from the bed and saying, &ldquo;Look at your
wife, is she not looking ghastly?&rdquo; went out of the room. Charlie
returned to his wife&rsquo;s side and looked closely at her. Her face
seemed strangely pallid and her hands were cold. He endeavoured to wake
her and was still trying to rouse her when Ethel returned to the room
followed by several of the servants, who looked excited. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1024" href="#xd20e1024" name=
"xd20e1024">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>In answer to his question, &ldquo;What is wrong with Alice?&rdquo;
Ethel said &ldquo;There are two thieves hidden behind the
<i>almirah</i>. Let the servants help you to secure them and then you
will know what is wrong with Alice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two Chinamen were soon routed out from behind the almirah,
captured and handed over to the police. A doctor was summoned and Alice
was brought out of the stupor, she had been thrown into by the fumes of
opium smoke. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1032" href="#xd20e1032"

<h2>An Unfaithful Servant.</h2>
<p>A rich zemindar named Bose lived in Lucknow, He had emigrated there
from Bengal, acquired land there, and studied the language until he
could speak Urdu like a Hindustanee. He became so much a native of
Lucknow that, when business took him down to Calcutta, he felt himself
a foreigner and stranger in Bengal.</p>
<p>His wife was an invalid and, as the years told on her, he had
frequently to take her to Calcutta for medical advice and treatment.
Their only child was a daughter who was the darling of their household.
The second favourite in the family was a boy called Ram, who though
really a servant was treated like a son of the house and both Mr. and
Mrs. Bose were very fond of him.</p>
<p>When quite a small boy, Ram had been taken into service in the Bose
menag&eacute;; and as his parents were both dead and he was remarkably
quick and intelligent, the zemindar took a fatherly interest in the lad
and had him taught to read and write. The teacher thought so highly of
Ram&rsquo;s intellect that he was taught one subject after another by
his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1042" href="#xd20e1042" name=
"xd20e1042">60</a>]</span>indulgent master, and when he grew older, was
especially educated and trained for estate work. When his education was
finished he was appointed to be confidential clerk and cashier, and
gradually grew to know as much of Bose&rsquo;s money affairs as the
zemindar did himself. Whenever the rich man went on his estate, Ram
went with him. At times of collection, Ram had the office of counting
the silver and locking it up in the cash box. Frequently thousands of
rupees passed through his hands in this way, and he alone always knew
what amount of money the cash box contained.</p>
<p>One year, Bose and the faithful Ram had been round the zemindari,
collecting rents; and, as many who had been in arrears paid up, they
returned with a larger sum of money than usual. This was locked up in
the cash box and Bose told his wife in Ram&rsquo;s hearing that next
day he should deposit it in the bank. The cash box was always kept at
night on a table by the zemindar&rsquo;s bed-side.</p>
<p>The Boses had a large house in Lucknow and it was nearly always
full, as Mrs. Bose was fond of company and they invariably had a number
of relatives and friends staying with them. Mr. and Mrs. Bose slept
upstairs in a large south room, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e1048" href="#xd20e1048" name="xd20e1048">61</a>]</span>opened
into another large room alongside of it. The only furniture in their
room was their two beds and a table which stood between the beds to
hold the cash box and a lantern.</p>
<p>The night of the zemindar&rsquo;s return, his wife could not sleep.
She had been ill and she counted the hours as the night wore on. The
light of the lantern showed her husband&rsquo;s sleeping form, the
naked sword which always hung at his bedpost, and the bare white-washed
walls of the room. As she lay awake, Mrs. Bose thought she heard a
noise at the door leading into the other room. The noise came again and
she listened intently. Some one opened the door and then shut it. Mrs.
Bose kept still, listened and watched. Some one again opened and shut
the door gently, then again and again. It struck Mrs. Bose that this
was being done to ascertain whether the inmates of the room were asleep
or awake. She continued to keep perfectly still.</p>
<p>Now the door was pushed wide open and Ram entered, and closed the
door softly behind him. When Mrs. Bose saw him enter, her first thought
was that he was the bearer of some bad news, and she very nearly asked
him what was the matter. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1054" href=
"#xd20e1054" name="xd20e1054">62</a>]</span>But his stealthy movements
made her feign sleep and see what he was about; and as he approached
her bed on tiptoe, she closed her eyes and lay as if peacefully
sleeping. He stood beside the bed apparently watching her. Mrs.
Bose&rsquo;s nerves were tingling with fear, and it took all her powers
of self-control to keep her eyes closed and her breath steady. Just as
the effort seemed more than she could keep up, Ram moved away from her
bed.</p>
<p>Through her eye-lashes she watched him creep noiselessly to the
table and examine the cash box. Then he returned to the side of her bed
and coughed. Mrs. Bose again succeeded in keeping perfectly still and
he moved round to his master&rsquo;s bedside. Here he stood motionless
for some seconds and then unfastened the sword. The zemindar was
sleeping heavily and as he detached the sword Ram smiled to himself as
if everything was very satisfactory. He grasped the sword in his right
hand and made a trial stroke. Then, smiling again, he lifted the
curtain of the zemindar&rsquo;s bed with his left hand.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bose felt sure that his motive was murder as well as robbery,
and she now shrieked loudly for aid. At the first sound of her voice
Ram dropped the sword and fled from the room. His wife&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1060" href="#xd20e1060" name=
"xd20e1060">63</a>]</span>piercing screams of &ldquo;Murder!
Help!&rdquo; woke the zemindar, but by the time he understood what had
taken place Ram had let himself out of the house and was gone.</p>
<p>When morning came the police were informed and the zemindar offered
a handsome reward for the arrest of Ram; but though the police hunted
in Lucknow and elsewhere and also searched the village where
Ram&rsquo;s relatives lived, no one knew anything of him and he was
never again heard of in Lucknow.</p>
<p>Some years after, the old zemindar died and one of the last remarks
he made was: &ldquo;I should like to know what has happened to poor
Ram.&rdquo; He had never forgotten his affection for his old protege,
and had quite forgiven him for his ungratefulness. <span class=

<h2>The Bearer&rsquo;s Fate</h2>
<p>Mr. Gupta, a Bengali gentleman, was a skilled engineer. The
Government thought highly of him and whenever any work of special
difficulty had to be undertaken, always chose him.</p>
<p>At one time he was stationed at Hazaribagh. This district is even
now infested with tigers, and in those far-off days these lords of the
jungle roamed far and wide.</p>
<p>There was then no railway. Travelling was done by <i>palki</i> or by
&ldquo;push-push&rdquo;&mdash;-a box-like carriage on four wheels, in
which the traveller was forced to recline, and which relays of coolies
pushed before them. The roads were often mere tracks through dense
forest.</p>
<p>It happened that Mr. Gupta was ordered to report on some important
work a few miles away. His devoted wife carefully packed his luggage.
They were a happy couple and each short parting was a pain in their
lives. A trustworthy old servant always accompanied his master to camp.
But to-day to his mistress&rsquo; surprise he begged not to go.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1086" href="#xd20e1086" name=
"xd20e1086">68</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Gupta came in, his wife told him of the man&rsquo;s
unwillingness to accompany him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Gupta, &ldquo;he will have to go. What
has happened to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he is ill&rdquo; the wife excusingly replied, her
tender heart full of the man&rsquo;s wistful face and strange manner.
Still she agreed with her husband and told the bearer, he must go with
his master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, I have high fever, <i>Ma-ji</i>,&rdquo; he
shivered, addressing her by the honoured name of mother, as is the
custom of Indian servants in an Indian household.</p>
<p>She turned again to her husband who said: &ldquo;I know what is in
the poor old fellow&rsquo;s mind. He has an idea he will be killed by a
tiger. However, tell him there is no danger. I am taking a large number
of bearers and he can keep near the <i>palki</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gupta tried to cheer the servant with this information but he
wailed: &ldquo;<i>Ma-ji</i>, I am afraid. Surely a tiger will kill me
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not fear,&rdquo; consoled the kind lady. &ldquo;Your
master will take good care of you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Go you must,&rdquo;
she continued in a firm tone. &ldquo;There is no one except you who
knows his ways and can see to his comfort. Now get ready
quickly.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1111" href=
"#xd20e1111" name="xd20e1111">69</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>Ma-ji</i>,&rdquo; he sobbed like a child, &ldquo;I
obey, but my heart is heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gupta had to travel through the night. After an early dinner he
started, attended by many <i>palki</i>-bearers and the old servant. The
moon rose bright and glorious and bathed the picturesque country in
soft radiance. The silence of the forest was broken only by the
rhythmic cries of the bearers and the <i>pat-pat</i> of their feet. The
first stream was reached and the bearers asked for a halt. Consent
granted, they went into the stream to drink of the deeper water. The
old servant crouched by the <i>palki</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirstest not?&rdquo; kindly asked his master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Babu-ji</i>, I feel nervous. I will stay near
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gupta wondered what might have unstrung the man, and felt sorry for
him. &ldquo;Come and sit close to me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The night was cold and the old bearer, huddled in his blanket, sat
on the edge of the <i>palki</i> door.</p>
<p>Suddenly the stillness of the night was broken by a rapid crash
through the dry grass near the <i>palki</i>, and with a thrilling roar
a tiger leapt at the man and dragged him away. The <i>palki</i> shook,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1150" href="#xd20e1150" name=
"xd20e1150">70</a>]</span>and the bearer&rsquo;s piteous cry
&ldquo;<i>Babu-ji, Babu-ji,</i> I told you&rdquo; filled the forest,
and echoed and echoed again as the tiger bore him away. Then all became
still.</p>
<p>Gupta realised what had happened. He lay back sick with horror, and
felt as if he were the guilty one. For many a day the old man&rsquo;s
dying wail rang in his ears. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1157"

<h2>Through the Roof</h2>
<p>They were laying the railway through the Hazaribagh district, and in
a low-roofed bungalow at Giridih lived the Engineer in charge of the
work. He was a young Englishman and his only recreation in this dreary
place was riding and shooting.</p>
<p>The coolies lived in frail little mat houses in the same enclosure
as his bungalow. One morning they came to him in a body to tell him
that during the night a tiger had carried off one of their cows. The
next morning another cow was missing, and on the third his servants
awakened him with the news that his Arab pony was gone.</p>
<p>He loved the little animal. Many a mile had he scoured on its back.
&ldquo;Stripes&rdquo; must be punished for this. He would sit up the
coming night and watch.</p>
<p>Babus, servants and coolies loudly approved. What was life worth
with such nightly happenings? and the lord of the jungle would surely
come again. Had he not discovered a well-filled larder?</p>
<p>Work over, the young man loaded his gun, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1171" href="#xd20e1171" name=
"xd20e1171">72</a>]</span>after dinner took up his position and awaited
the enemy. A reliable servant sat up with him.</p>
<p>The bungalow was raised on piles a few feet from the ground. It had
brick walls but a thatched roof which sloped very low down on all
sides. The wooden windows were closed. Our friend sat at one of them
with the Venetians slightly stretched. The bungalow was dark and
still.</p>
<p>At last a strange odour filled the air and then the heavy breathing
of the tiger was audible. It came and stood just outside the window.
The young fellow noiselessly pointed his gun through the Venetians and
fired. An angry growl told that the tiger was wounded. Then it charged
forward with a furious roar. The Englishman fired again and this time
thought he had finished it. But the animal charged again with increased
rage. After several attempts at the window it leapt for the roof and
succeeded in clutching the eaves and scrambled up. The terrified
servant cried: &ldquo;Saheb, come into another room&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool!&rdquo; shouted his master, &ldquo;the
tiger can&rsquo;t come through the roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In their huts the poor coolies heard the shots and the terrible
roars and growls and dared not come <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e1181" href="#xd20e1181" name="xd20e1181">73</a>]</span>to their
master&rsquo;s assistance. The tiger tore and scratched the thatch with
all his might and soon made a hole. &ldquo;Look! Saheb!&rdquo; screamed
the servant, &ldquo;he comes through&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a loaded gun in my hand&rdquo;, the Saheb replied.</p>
<p>The hole speedily grew larger as the great cat clawed and growled.
The servant could stand it no longer. He bolted into the next room,
shutting the door between. There he shivered and shook till morning,
when he fled to the railway station a couple of miles away and told the
Sahibs there his tale. They got guns and horses and rode over. They
peered through the shutters and saw the tiger in the room. It soon
scented them and charged with a mighty roar. They retreated without
dignity to a safe distance where all stopped. One said, &ldquo;I say!
we must see what has happened to the poor chap&rdquo;. Another:
&ldquo;So many of us and loaded guns! We must do something&rdquo;. A
third: &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get back and kill the beast&rdquo;.</p>
<p>They went back and fired shot after shot through the shutters till
the animal was killed. Then they broke into the room and found their
luckless comrade dead on the floor, his loaded gun <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1190" href="#xd20e1190" name=
"xd20e1190">74</a>]</span>still in his hand. The tiger must have killed
him with a slap of its mighty paw, and sat on his body all night, but
clearly the animal was not a man-eater. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e1192" href="#xd20e1192" name="xd20e1192">79</a>]</span></p>

<h2>Earning the Reward</h2>
<p>A man-eating tiger was roaming through Hazaribagh station. It had
killed many villagers and had become so daring that it entered the
market-place in broad day-light.</p>
<p>A poor old tailor on his way home one evening was seized by the
blood-thirsty animal, and his screams for help filled the little town.
The morning light showed traces of the struggle between man and beast,
and where the latter had been dragged from the main road.</p>
<p>The villagers did <i>puja</i> that night that all might be saved
from a like fate. A few days after, a ploughman and a little boy stood
talking about the tiger. &ldquo;How do you know that he won&rsquo;t
catch you?&rdquo; asked the boy.</p>
<p>The ploughman answered confidently: &ldquo;I have done
<i>puja</i>&rdquo;. Barely had the words passed his lips than the tiger
leapt upon him. The boy was startled, but not realising his own danger
not only did he not run but also caught up a stick and tried to save
his friend. In spite of his hitting it the animal began to devour the
unfortunate man, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1210" href=
"#xd20e1210" name="xd20e1210">76</a>]</span>snarling threateningly the
while. Then the boy threw away the stick and fled to the village. The
news roused the villagers and they determined to try to rid themselves
of their foe. Armed with spears, sticks and heavy bamboos they followed
the boy to the scene of the tragedy. But the tiger was gone.</p>
<p>The Government had offered a handsome reward to any one who would
succeed in killing this tiger and now a poor shop-keeper determined to
win it. He knew nothing of shooting but worked up the ambition of a
friend who could shoot and had a couple of guns. Together they essayed
the difficult job. Difficult it was. The tiger seldom returned to his
kill, nor stopped at a kill any length of time, and was known to have
killed three or four victims in one day.</p>
<p>However they hoped for success. The villagers had been very careful
of late and the tiger had consequently been obliged to go hungry. It
was just possible he might return to the kill. So they got permission
for a mangled body to be left there, and built a <i>machan</i> near it.
At sunset they took up their places and watched.</p>
<p>At first the pair felt cheerful. A brilliant <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1221" href="#xd20e1221" name=
"xd20e1221">77</a>]</span>moon illuminated the whole country making
everything as clear as day. But no tiger came. And later, as the hours
dragged on, their cramped position, the nearness of a dead body, the
silence and mystery of the night, all got on their nerves, and they
wished they had not attempted such a task. But to leave now would be
dangerous. So they did their best to encourage each other and waited
on.</p>
<p>In the small hours of the night they distinctly heard the tiger
coming and saw a huge black shadow moving stealthily towards their
tree. The animal looked enormous in the uncertain light and each
thought the <i>machan</i> too low and wished himself in his house in
the village. Neither dared to speak or move.</p>
<p>Not far from the <i>machan</i> was a hillock. The tiger, after
stalking round the tree, went to the corpse, smelled it, and then
crossing to the hillock climbed up and sat himself there. The men felt
sure he could now see them.</p>
<p>The tiger began to sniff as if he scented them. Then it yawned and
snarled. The men sat fascinated. Presently the great head turned
towards them. The shopman pulled the trigger of the gun <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1235" href="#xd20e1235" name=
"xd20e1235">78</a>]</span>he held. There was a deafening roar and the
tiger disappeared from the hillock. Then all became still. They knew by
the roar of pain that he was hit. Tigers are clever and often feign
death when wounded. They dared not descend. They were not sure that he
was killed. At any moment he might attack their tree. Comrades in
enterprise and fear, they sat gripping each other in the darkness, for
the moon had now set.</p>
<p>The villagers had heard the shot and at day-break came to the spot.
They found the tiger lying dead at the foot of the hillock. The heroes
could barely descend from the <i>machan</i>, so stiff and aching were
their bones. Together they received the plaudits of the village and
shared the Government reward which to them was quite a small fortune.

<h2>A Burmese Monster</h2>
<p>Some years ago Government sent an engineer and party to explore and
prospect in the forests of Burma. None returned. Their disappearance
was a mystery.</p>
<p>The authorities decided to send another party to ascertain the fate
of the first and continue the work. To induce volunteers, a handsome
salary was offered; and at length an Englishman came forward. He asked
for twice the number of native attendants that the first man had had.
Government granted him his request and provided him with every facility
procurable and he started.</p>
<p>He followed the course taken by his predecessor up a large river. He
travelled in a big boat and his men in smaller ones. Here and there
they came upon traces of the former party. They pushed on. Suddenly all
indications of the missing ones ceased. He felt he had better stop and
investigate. Tents were landed and pitched and the men began to prepare
their evening meal.</p>
<p>As he sat in his tent reading, he heard loud shouts and some of his
coolies rushed to him. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1255"
href="#xd20e1255" name="xd20e1255">80</a>]</span>said that as they were
cooking they saw a great black thing hanging from a tree above them.
When they made a noise it disappeared. It was long and thick and black.
The coolies were frightened out of their wits and refused to remain in
that place. Argument was of no use; so the tents were taken down and
the party moved on.</p>
<p>Another spot was selected and here they stayed peacefully for some
days. Suddenly a man was missing. Then another and another! Each
disappeared when alone. The coolies were frightened and uneasy. But
this time the Sahib managed to control them. He himself was anxious and
puzzled.</p>
<p>Next a coolie who had gone to the river to scour vessels after a
meal disappeared. The plates and <i>lotas</i> were scattered about just
as if he had been suddenly seized. The Englishman thought that a
crocodile must have taken him off.</p>
<p>Soon after this incident the engineer was fishing in the river
opposite to the camp, and he noticed two coolies coming to the river.
They sat down at the <i>ghat</i> and began to scour their vessels. The
murmur of their voices reached him.</p>
<p>Presently the boatman clutched his arm and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1271" href="#xd20e1271" name=
"xd20e1271">81</a>]</span>pointed to the bank. He looked. One of the
coolies was chasing a huge hairy monster. The other could not be
seen.</p>
<p>The engineer soon crossed the river and joined the coolie, still in
the chase after the strange creature. As usual, the Saheb carried a
loaded revolver and as he ran he fired several shots at the animal.
They had no effect on it. The beast ran on with heavy lumbering
strides, covering the ground with great rapidity and only once glancing
back over its shoulders with a horrible grin. He could not overtake it
and it disappeared into the thick jungle. Its hair was so long that it
completely covered the man it carried in its powerful arms. It was some
kind of an orang-outang.</p>
<p>The mystery was now cleared up. The engineer returned. His task was
accomplished. Later he wrote an account of this adventure and concluded
with these words:&mdash;&ldquo;Now when I see a great hairy spider I
tremble! and the remembrance of that monstrous black form returns to
me, and the hideous grin that thrilled me. Never can I forget
it.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1277" href="#xd20e1277"

<h2>The Palki and the Tiger</h2>
<p>In a lonely village in the Hazaribagh district the peaceful dwellers
were one evening disturbed by shrill cries of distress. When they
gathered round the house from whence the cries came, they discovered
that a ghastly murder had been committed. The headman of the village
immediately despatched two messengers for the police. These men started
in the dawn and reached the Police outpost just before sunset.</p>
<p>The Inspector-in-charge was a Bengalee, named Bose, who was a very
intelligent officer and keen on his work. As soon as he received
information of the murder, he ordered one of his staff to arrange for a
<i>push-push</i> (carriage which is partly drawn and partly pushed by
men) and a set of bearers. He quickly put together a few requisites for
the journey, and was soon ready. The night was not far advanced when
the orderly returned with a <i>push-push</i> and eight bearers, and
Bose started off, attended by his cook and body-servant.</p>
<p>The road lay through a forest. At times the path was so narrow and
rocky that the men could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1293" href=
"#xd20e1293" name="xd20e1293">83</a>]</span>make little progress, and
at last they declared that the road was impassable for a wheeled
conveyance, and that it was necessary for the Inspector to change into
a <i>palki</i>. One of them said that about two miles off the road
there was a village, and that in the village there lived a rich
Hindustani merchant who might lend a <i>palki</i>. Bose was pleased at
the suggestion and told the <i>push-push</i> bearers to take him to the
village. They needed no second bidding, and the Inspector was soon
being trundled across the paddy fields that lay between the village and
the road. Arrived there, he hastened to the merchant&rsquo;s house and
asked to see him.</p>
<p>A handsome up-countryman came out and when, he saw that his visitor
was a gentleman he courteously asked him to enter and be seated. The
Inspector soon explained his necessity for a <i>palki</i>, and the rich
man placed his at the disposal of the police officer. &ldquo;But
<i>Jenab</i> (Sir),&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;tigers are bad in this
forest and you have to pass through a part known to be a favourite
haunt of theirs. Have you any fire-arms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only my revolver,&rdquo; said Bose &ldquo;but I must push on
and take my chance.&rdquo; And as the <i>palki</i> now stood ready and
the bearers declared themselves <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e1317" href="#xd20e1317" name="xd20e1317">84</a>]</span>refreshed,
he thanked his host for his ready assistance, bade him farewell and
started once again.</p>
<p>The bearers were full of spirits after their rest at the
merchant&rsquo;s house and for a mile or two travelled at a rapid pace;
but the narrow winding road impeded their progress, and as the night
advanced the eerie sounds of the forest must have got on their nerves.
At the commencement of the journey they had beguiled the march with
stories of tigers and bears met in the forest, but after some hours of
travel they became silent; and beyond the usual directions of the
forward men concerning the road and occasionally a shrill cry to scare
away wild animals, they made no remarks to each other.</p>
<p>Within the <i>palki</i>, Bose lay fitfully dozing. The night was
oppressive and his thoughts were on the murder and his chances of a
successful capture of the wrong-doer. The road had become wider and
level and the men were going along at a good pace, when suddenly they
dropped the <i>palki</i> to the ground and fled in all directions. Bose
shouted: &ldquo;What is up? Why have you run away?&rdquo; No answer
greeted his ears but a strange odour penetrated his nostrils and he
knew there was a tiger in the jungle. He quickly pulled the doors of
the <i>palki</i> jamming <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1332" href=
"#xd20e1332" name="xd20e1332">85</a>]</span>them as securely as he
could with the ends of his <i>razai</i> (quilt). Then he tore the
strong border off his <i>dhoti</i> (loin cloth) and commenced to bind
the handles of the doors together. He had just finished firmly lashing
together the handles on one side when he heard an ominous growling.
With frantic haste he bound the handles of the opposite doors together,
praying fervently that he might escape the jaws of the tiger.</p>
<p>The animal continued growling. Evidently the dark bulk of the
<i>palki</i> frightened him. Bose sat inside, huddled in a heap and
breathless. The tiger, re-assured by the stillness of the object before
him, ceased growling; and presently, the soft thud of his feet and his
sniffing round the <i>palki</i> told the trembling man within that
&rsquo;Stripes&rsquo; was making an investigation.</p>
<p>Now a mighty roar shook the jungles and Bose realised that the tiger
had leapt upon the roof of the <i>palki</i> and was scratching
furiously at it. Bose clutched the handles of the doors and held on to
them with the grip of despair. The tiger scratched and growled and
finally bounded off the top and began a vigorous assault upon the side.
The <i>palki</i> toppled over on to its other side. Poor Bose
congratulated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1357" href=
"#xd20e1357" name="xd20e1357">86</a>]</span>himself that now one of the
doors rested upon Mother Earth and he could give his whole energy to
defending the other. He gripped the handles with renewed determination
and waited.</p>
<p>The tiger had sustained a shock at seeing the unknown monster he was
tackling roll over, and for a time satisfied himself by growling
savagely. But as the monster lay still &ldquo;Stripes&rdquo; tried the
experiment of a sharp blow with his paw. The <i>palki</i> rested on
uneven ground and the blow made it rock. The tiger waited awhile; and
when the rocking had subsided administered another stroke. The
<i>palki</i> rocked again. The situation now developed into a game
between the huge cat and the <i>palki</i>. When he slapped the
<i>palki</i> rocked; and when the <i>palki</i> ceased vibrating the
tiger slapped again. Inside the <i>palki</i>, the Inspector held on to
the handles of the door and prayed for deliverance.</p>
<p>At last the tiger, wearied of the game and purring loudly, walked
away. Bose breathed more freely but knew not if the danger was past.
There he lay gripping the handles of the door and wishing for daylight.
At last the dawn broke and with the first rays of light courage
returned to the bearers and servants, who were hiding in the branches
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1383" href="#xd20e1383" name=
"xd20e1383">87</a>]</span>the surrounding trees. They called to each
other, expressing anxiety as to their master&rsquo;s fate. Finally, as
the daylight grew stronger they encouraged each other to descend and
approach the <i>palki</i>.</p>
<p>As they examined it with wonder some very cutting remarks from
within assured them of their master&rsquo;s existence, and with many
apologies for the abrupt way in which they had abandoned him they
righted the <i>palki</i> and assisted him out.</p>
<p>The journey was soon resumed and Bose had the satisfaction of
arresting the murderer in spite of his ill-timed adventure and forced
delay. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1395" href="#xd20e1395" name=

<h2>An Assam Adventure</h2>
<p>Some years ago, an English baron came out to India to enjoy some
tiger shooting. He received invitations to many Native States, and was
having a right royal time. In the course of his wanderings he came to
Assam. In those days, the jungles of Assam swarmed with tigers but a
&ldquo;man-eater&rdquo; was very rarely known there.</p>
<p>Sir M. was in a small camp with just two or three other guns, and
all were hopeful of &ldquo;bagging&rdquo; a tiger, for the roaring of
the lords of the jungle could be heard almost every night. The tents
had been pitched on the bank of a river and all round the camp and on
the opposite bank was heavy jungle. Wild animals abounded in these
jungles and the camp servants did not appreciate the site. No sooner
had the Sahebs finished their dinner than the servants disappeared into
their tents, and securing themselves within, as strongly as they could,
devoutly hoped that the morning light would find them still alive and
unharmed.</p>
<p>One evening Sir M. retired to his own tent immediately after dinner.
He was very tired but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1405" href=
"#xd20e1405" name="xd20e1405">89</a>]</span>as he was not sleepy, he
made himself comfortable and settled down on a long-sleeved chair with
a book. His tent was a small one, with a camp cot, a couple of chairs
and a table. On the table stood a reading lamp. M. was soon absorbed in
his book and did not notice how the hours fled. The camp became quiet
and still. It was a dark close night and the door of his tent stood
open, for he was a lover of air. He had read on for some time when his
attention was drawn to a movement of his tent wall. It seemed to him as
if some one or something was rubbing along the side. He put down his
book and got on to his feet to see what it could be. As he was about to
step forward the head of a tiger loomed in the doorway, the eyes
gleaming brightly. Sir M. stood motionless with surprise and
&ldquo;Stripes&rdquo; stepped into the tent. He was a fine specimen of
a Royal Bengal tiger, and M. forgot everything in his admiration of the
noble animal.</p>
<p>The table with the lamp upon it stood between Sir M. and the tiger,
and each stood on either side of it gazing at each other. As the silent
seconds passed, Sir M. realized that he was in danger and bethought him
of his rifle which was almost within reach of his hand; but he dared
not move and so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1409" href=
"#xd20e1409" name="xd20e1409">90</a>]</span>continued gazing
steadfastly at his visitor. The tiger too stood, surveying his
vis-a-vis and then began to move round the table. The lamp either
attracted or annoyed him and he raised his paw to the table. The weight
of the huge paw tilted the table, the lamp toppled and fell with a
crash. The terrified tiger gave a mighty roar, turned tail and
fled.</p>
<p>The camp was aroused. Everyone shouted and rushed out into the
night, armed with some weapon or other. Sir M. related to his brother
guns what had happened and they all enjoyed a good laugh and rather
envied him for the fine sight he had of such a superb specimen of the
kings of the jungle. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1413" href=

<h2>A Thrilling Story</h2>
<p>One evening, in Assam, a young Englishman was driving along a lonely
jungle road. He wished to visit a neighbouring Saheb; and though his
servants had warned him that tigers had been frequently seen on that
particular road, he had laughed at their fears and told them that the
only tiger to be feared was a &ldquo;man-eater&rdquo;, and that there
were no &ldquo;man-eating&rdquo; tigers about that district. As usual
in the mofussil of India, he was going out to dine and sleep, and his
bearer had put up his clothes and his suit case was stowed into the
dog-cart.</p>
<p>The road was a good one and considerably wide, for it was the main
thoroughfare in the district and along it tea, jute and all other
agricultural products were transported to the river for export to other
districts of India and also to Europe. Nevertheless it was bordered on
either side by dense jungle, and there were few villages in its
vicinity. After sunset it was a road little frequented by villagers and
it had the reputation of being tiger-haunted. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1421" href="#xd20e1421" name=
"xd20e1421">92</a>]</span></p>
<p>There was no moon and, as B. had not started much before sunset,
darkness soon overtook him on the road. As he had no <i>syce</i> with
him he got down to light the trap-lamps and jumped in and drove on
again very cheerily. He was not far from where he must turn off the
main road to the narrow one leading to his friend&rsquo;s estate, when
the pony suddenly took fright at something and bolted. At first B.
tried to pull the animal up; but its erect ears and wild snorting
showed him that there was cause for alarm. He looked over his shoulder
and in the dim starlight discerned the bulk of some animal in pursuit
of them. An eerie feeling came over him and he wondered what was going
to happen. He sat tight in his seat and let the pony race on. The chase
continued and the pony began to show signs of collapse. It was
evidently being overcome by fear and, in spite of all B.&rsquo;s
urging, could not keep up the pace, and the pursuing animal gained upon
them. B. had just determined to leap from the cart when the pony
tripped and fell and B. was shot out of the cart. He fell into the long
grass on the side of the road, and had barely collected himself when a
dark form sprang upon the pony.</p>
<p>The poor animal neighed with fear but kicked <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1429" href="#xd20e1429" name=
"xd20e1429">93</a>]</span>and fought its foe. B. rolled down the side
of the road and began to crawl away through the jungle as fast as he
could. Long grass and thorny brambles grew on either side of the road
and as it was the dry season every movement of his made a crackling and
rustling; and often he fancied he heard an animal in pursuit of him, or
he would imagine he was about to meet one coming through the jungle
towards him. He pressed on as fast as he could, sometimes crawling and
sometimes walking, and at last he saw the glimmer of lights and came to
some huts. He shouted to the inmates who came to his assistance.</p>
<p>When they discovered a Saheb in such a plight they were full of
concern, helped him to their huts, gave him hot milk to drink and
washed his wounds. His clothes were torn and his hands and knees
bleeding from his flight through the thorny jungle. The sympathising
villagers emptied a hut for him to rest in, and when morning came
escorted him to the scene of his mishap.</p>
<p>The mangled remains of his poor pony told him that the wild animal
had been a very famished tiger. B. returned to his own bungalow a wiser
man, and told his servants that, had he taken their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1435" href="#xd20e1435" name=
"xd20e1435">94</a>]</span>advice, he would not have suffered such an
adventure or the loss of his pony. He rewarded the villagers for their
kindness and hospitality and for a long time his escape was the talk of
the district. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1437" href=

<h2>A Cachar Tiger</h2>
<p>In the province of Assam lies a fertile and picturesque valley
called Cachar. Shut in on north, south and east by lofty hills, this
valley remained hidden for centuries and was never conquered by any of
the Mahommedan rulers of India.</p>
<p>Here a race of aboriginal kings held sway, and it was the East India
Company who first became masters of this hilly corner of Bengal. In
1830, the last of the old Cachari kings died without heir, and
&ldquo;Company Bahadoor&rdquo; took possession of the little
kingdom.</p>
<p>In 1855, the discovery of the tea-plant, growing wild in the
jungles, opened out a new industry, and soon the low-lying hills,
knolls and undulating plains of the little valley became gradually
clear of jungle, and covered instead with row after row of
carefully-kept and trim tea bushes. To-day acres upon acres of tea are
grown in Cachar; and the inland steamers, which ply all through the
rainy season up and down the wide-rolling stream of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1447" href="#xd20e1447" name=
"xd20e1447">96</a>]</span>river Barak, bring down for export millions
of pounds of tea for the &ldquo;cheering cup&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Cachar is rich in forests, and tigers and other wild animals are
there in plenty. During the monsoon the jungle animals retreat to the
higher levels of the forest-clad hills. But when the rains abate they
begin to gradually descend; and when the great &ldquo;hoars&rdquo; or
fenlands dry up at the approach of the cold season, numerous tigers
take up their winter haunts in the patches of jungle, which grow here
and there in the marsh lands, and in the forests which often surround
or separate the tea gardens.</p>
<p>It was cold-weather time about forty years ago, and four planters
sat talking after dinner in the Manager&rsquo;s bungalow on a tea
garden in Cachar. We will call them M., B., C. and H.</p>
<p>The bungalow, like many bungalows in tea districts, stood on a high
hill, the steep sides of which had been terraced and planted with tea.
On adjacent but lower hills stood the factory and coolie lines.
Everything was quiet and lay wrapped in a heavy fog.</p>
<p>In the verandah near the steps sat the bungalow <i>chowkidar</i>
(watchman). The charity of the Tea Company had provided him and his
fellow-coolies <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1460" href=
"#xd20e1460" name="xd20e1460">97</a>]</span>with blankets. And he wore
his in the usual <i>pachim</i> (North-West Provinces) style: one end of
the blanket is pleated and tied closely with a piece of string, the
short part above the cord forming a tuft. The wearer pulls the pleated
end of the blanket over his head, the tuft resting on his crown. The
sides of the blanket are drawn round the body, and thus the blanket is
made to form both a hood and a cloak, in which the wearer hugs himself
against the inclemency of the weather.</p>
<p>The <i>chowkidar</i> sat on his mat huddled up in his blanket,
droning one of the time-honoured <i>bhajans</i> (hymns) of India.</p>
<p>Presently he disappeared and, next, piercing yells rent the
mist-laden atmosphere. The four Sahebs were in the verandah in a trice,
and soon discovered the <i>chowkidar</i> returning to the verandah,
visibly shaken and without his blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, and who shouted?&rdquo; asked the
Manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saheb,&rdquo; the <i>chowkidar</i> replied in a quavering
voice &ldquo;a tiger sprang on me and caught the knot of my
blanket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; interrupted the four Englishmen incredulously.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1488" href="#xd20e1488" name=
"xd20e1488">98</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>Huzoor</i> (Your Honour), as I sat here against this
post the tiger came, seized the knot of my blanket and began to pull.
Like lightning I made my plan. I grasped with a strong tight hold the
sides of the blanket and holding myself together like a ball I let Lord
Tiger pull. He dragged me to the edge of the <i>tila</i> (hill). There
I suddenly let go the blanket and shouted with all my might. The tiger
fell over, down the hill, and is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, there were the foot-marks of the tiger, the mark of the
drag, and the signs of where &ldquo;Stripes&rdquo; had slipped over and
down the terrace.</p>
<p>The tiger had been harrying the coolies for some time and a rumour
had got about that he was a man-eater. It was pretty certain that he
would come again the next night; so the planters determined to sit up
and shoot him.</p>
<p>On the following night after dinner M. B. C. and H. took their
positions on the verandah. Each had his loaded gun and all waited
patiently for the tiger. Time passed. It was weary work and they
dozed.</p>
<p>M.&rsquo;s dog had wandered off to the kitchen as usual after
dinner. After some time it returned hurriedly and ran up the steps of
the verandah, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1505" href=
"#xd20e1505" name="xd20e1505">99</a>]</span>barking in a frightened
manner. The dog&rsquo;s barking woke the four men. B. sat first near
the steps and H. not far from him in a dining-room chair.</p>
<p>The dog ran into the dining-room and hid himself under the table and
everything again became quiet, and the men waited. Suddenly a hoarse
cry paralysed three of them. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s on me. Shoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiger had come up on to the verandah and springing at B. caught
him by the arm. Then, releasing the arm, he made a spring at his
victim&rsquo;s throat. B. was instantly on his feet and, as the tiger
essayed his throat, he rammed his clenched fist into the animal&rsquo;s
mouth. The tiger shook the man&rsquo;s fist out of its mouth and made
another attempt to reach his throat. B. repeated his manoeuvre. This
happened three or four times.</p>
<p>In the meantime the other three men dared not shoot for fear of
missing the ferocious cat and killing their comrade. H. had the
presence of mind to swiftly fix his bayonet, and, rushing towards the
tiger, he thrust it in the animal&rsquo;s side, firing as he did so.
The tiger fell backwards off the verandah mortally wounded, but to the
amazement <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1513" href="#xd20e1513"
name="xd20e1513">100</a>]</span>of the Sahebs struggled tip and made
another attempt to get at B. He was however too badly wounded and fell
back dead.</p>
<p>B.&rsquo;s hand and arm were terribly mauled, and after medical
treatment he had to go home on long leave. <span class=

<h2>A Maharajah&rsquo;s Adventures</h2>
<p>A Maharajah of Bengal who became a noted sportsman shot his first
tiger when he was quite a small boy. When about twelve years of age he
went out on a shoot one cold weather on his estate. He was accompanied
by some of his relatives, and they encamped in one of the forest
bungalows. This bungalow was just an ordinary Assam house built on a
<i>chang</i> or raised platform. It consisted of a large centre room
with a bedroom on either side and a deep verandah in the front, where
the servants slept at night. Under large trees, some little distance
away, the elephants were chained, and not far off were stables for the
horses.</p>
<p>The Maharajah shared his room with a friend, a lad about two years
older than himself. One night between ten and eleven o&rsquo;clock,
when all were in bed and asleep after a tiring day and an early dinner,
the near roaring of a tiger awakened the camp. In a twinkling the
servants had transferred themselves and their bedding from the verandah
into the centre room and securely bolted the door. Roar after roar
sounded through the night, but the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e1528" href="#xd20e1528" name="xd20e1528">102</a>]</span>young
Maharajah slept the healthful and deep sleep of tired childhood and the
mighty voice of the lord of the jungle did not disturb him. His friend
was awakened by the majestic sound and lay trembling with fear; envying
his blissfully unconscious companion, until the nearness of the tiger
broke down his self-control and, vigorously shaking his bed-fellow, he
shouted in his ear: &ldquo;Tiger, tiger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young Maharajah awoke, yawned, stretched and listened. The
roaring had ceased but under the bungalow they could hear the purring
of a tiger as it rubbed itself against a post. The younger and fearless
boy laughed with glee and assured his friend that there was no danger
of the tiger getting into the bungalow, and that on the morrow they
would be easily able to track and shoot it. Soon the sounds of purring
and rubbing gave place to others, and the occupants of the bungalow
realised that more than one tiger played beneath them. Next day in the
jungle near the forest bungalow the party shot a couple of tigers, a
tigress and her cubs.</p>
<p>In later years the Maharajah became famous for his shoots and many
and varied were his adventures <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1534"
href="#xd20e1534" name="xd20e1534">103</a>]</span>and experiences. One
year he was in camp with a large party and they were out one afternoon
after buffaloes. A fine bull was driven out of a patch of thick jungle
and faced the guns with defiance in his eyes. He was a grand target and
the Maharajah&rsquo;s finger ached to pull his trigger, but courtesy
forbade him and he generously, as always, left the fine prize for his
guests. But, one after another, each missed his shot and the noble bull
charged past into thicker jungle. As the line of guns attempted to
follow, one of them spied a leopard up on a tree looking thoroughly
scared. This animal had evidently been disturbed by the commotion in
the forest and had been so terrified that it had climbed into a tree
for shelter; and there, on a branch, poor &ldquo;Spots&rdquo; fell an
easy prey to the sportsmen.</p>
<p>One of the strangest adventures that the Maharajah had was when,
returning to camp one evening, he was informed that one of his largest
and best elephants, &ldquo;Kennedy&rdquo;, had got stuck in quicksand.
In many parts of Assam there are quicksands and quagmires. This
particular one chanced to be in a <i>nala</i> (stream). The elephant
had refused to cross the partially dried-up stream. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1541" href="#xd20e1541" name=
"xd20e1541">104</a>]</span>Instinct had warned him through the tip of
his trunk that danger lurked there, but his <i>mahout</i> (driver),
anxious to get into camp after a hard day and knowing that across this
stream was a short cut, had forced him. They had advanced but a yard or
two when the huge animal began to sink, and the more he struggled and
strove to extricate himself the deeper he sank. The Maharajah hastened
to the spot as soon as he heard of the catastrophe, for
&ldquo;Kennedy&rdquo; was a fine and valuable elephant and a steady one
for <i>shikar</i> (shooting). At the sound of his master&rsquo;s voice
poor &ldquo;Kennedy&rdquo; looked towards the bank, and the Maharajah
saw that great tears of anguish were rolling down the poor
beast&rsquo;s face as he bellowed in an agony of fear. The Maharajah
directed the men who had gathered around the scene to fell some
saplings, which were conveyed to the <i>nala</i> by some smaller
elephant and pushed into the quagmire towards &ldquo;Kennedy&rdquo;.
The poor entrapped animal seemed to understand that efforts were being
made to rescue him, and he obeyed his driver&rsquo;s now soothing voice
and held himself still. At last, the combined labours of men and
brother-elephants provided a safe footing of submerged saplings and
branches; and &ldquo;Kennedy&rdquo; pulled himself out of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1553" href="#xd20e1553" name=
"xd20e1553">105</a>]</span>treacherous sand and was escorted back to
the camp with great rejoicings.</p>
<p>Not long after this &ldquo;Kennedy&rdquo; distinguished himself in
another way, but this time evoked the displeasure and not the pity of
his good master. An engineer, named Ashton, had charge of the
<i>feilkhana</i> (elephant stables) and had once severely punished
&ldquo;Kennedy&rdquo;. After the manner of his kind, the elephant bore
the memory of the outrage in his heart and waited the opportunity to be
revenged. One morning the camp was astir for a shoot. The guests stood
ready outside their tents and the elephants were waiting to carry them
into the forest. Suddenly &ldquo;Kennedy&rdquo; charged at Ashton, who
stood a little apart from the group, and flinging him to the ground
began to roll him under his feet. The Maharajah, with wonderful
presence of mind, immediately ordered &ldquo;Debraj&rdquo;, a larger
and more powerful elephant than &ldquo;Kennedy&rdquo; and his rival in
the <i>feilkhana</i>, to the rescue. &ldquo;Debraj&rsquo;s&rdquo;
<i>mahout</i> ordered him to charge at &ldquo;Kennedy&rdquo;, and,
urged forward with voice and prong; &ldquo;Debraj&rdquo; did so with a
good will. When &ldquo;Kennedy&rdquo; saw his ancient enemy charging at
him, he forgot his grudge against Ashton, and, considering that
&ldquo;he who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1566" href=
"#xd20e1566" name="xd20e1566">106</a>]</span>fights and runs away lives
to fight another day&rdquo;, he bolted, with his trunk in the air.
Ashton was picked up from the dust very much shaken by his rolling and
fright but, to the astonishment of every one, in no way injured.</p>
<p>During one of his shooting expeditions, the Maharajah and his
companions decided one night that they would go out on foot at the very
break of dawn and see the animal world in the jungle; and they were
well rewarded for their adventurous spirit. In a glade of the forest
they had a magnificent sight of a large herd of bison peacefully
grazing in the dewy grass. They could hear tigers and bears passing
back through the jungles to their dens in the deeper forest, and as the
men stood there admiring the grand heads of the bison a monstrous tiger
passed along quite close to one of the party, the Maharajah&rsquo;s
brother-in-law. On the bank of a river they came upon a nest of young
pythons. The guests thought it was a curious mound; but the Maharajah
recognised the reared heads of the young snakes and told his friends
what the heap was. When they came closer, they could see that the long
slimy bodies were all twisted together; and with an uncanny feeling,
the sportsmen watched these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1570"
href="#xd20e1570" name="xd20e1570">107</a>]</span>serpents uncoil
themselves from each other and glide away and disappear through the
grass.</p>
<p>Once, after a long and fruitless day in the jungles, the Maharajah
decided he would try his luck stalking some deer that he spied on the
opposite side of a narrow strip of jungle. He accordingly left his
elephant and began to creep through the long dry bramble-choked grass
with his rifle in his hand. As he pushed his way through the thick
jungle he fancied he heard an animal breathing and then something
crackled. Intent on the deer before him, he concluded that he had
broken a twig or a branch with the end of his rifle and pushed on. As
he emerged from the thicket on the opposite side from where he had
entered, he came face to face with a group of shepherds. They stared at
him in amazement and then, recognising him as their Maharajah, fell at
his feet in rapturous joy. Accustomed as he was to demonstrations from
his people, their abandon struck him as something unusual, and he was
about to question them when they exclamed: &ldquo;<i>Hoozoor,
Dharmabatar</i>, (Your Honor, Royal Master,) how did you come in safety
through that jungle?&rdquo; He smiled at their wonderment and was about
to chide them gently when they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1577"
href="#xd20e1577" name="xd20e1577">108</a>]</span>continued: &ldquo;An
immense tiger has just slain one of our cows and dragged it into that
very jungle from which Your Honor has emerged.&rdquo; The Maharajah now
understood that the sound he had heard as he pushed his way through the
jungle was the tiger enjoying a feed of his kill, and he felt thankful
that he had not stumbled directly upon it. Like the keen sportsman he
was, he signalled his elephant and, mounting it, secured the feasting
tiger with an easy shot.</p>
<p>One cold season, the Viceroy was enjoying a shoot on the
Maharajah&rsquo;s estates. One evening, as they were dressing for
dinner, there came through the stillness of the restful air the
&ldquo;twitter&rdquo; of a tiger. Do many of my readers know what the
&ldquo;twitter&rdquo; of a tiger is? It is a sound the Monarch of the
Jungle makes and it is just like the twitter of a bird;&mdash;in fact,
some declare it <i>is</i> only the twitter of a bird. Well, on this
particular evening, the tiger must have been passing quite close to the
camp, for his &ldquo;twitter&rdquo; was clear and unmistakeable. The
Maharajah, with his usual courtesy, immediately bethought himself of
his guests, and invited Their Excellencies to come out into the open
and listen to the novel sound. They did, and very <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1584" href="#xd20e1584" name=
"xd20e1584">109</a>]</span>pleased and proud they were when they heard
the tiger&rsquo;s &ldquo;twitter&rdquo; clearly and distinctly through
the gathering shade and stillness of the darkening night.</p>
<p>The shooting camps were invariably pitched on the bank of a river or
stream. One evening, two of the servants crossed the shallow stream in
front of the camp to enjoy some fishing. They found a suitable place
behind a mound and here they sat quietly watching their lines. The
afternoon hours passed swiftly and the sun was nearing the horizon when
their attention was simultaneously drawn to a sound above their heads.
Looking up, to their horror, they saw an immense tiger just above them.
One of them shivered with terror and, clutching his companion, said in
a hoarse whisper: &ldquo;Our hour has come.&rdquo; The other whispered
back: &ldquo;Keep perfectly still and quiet.&rdquo; Breathless, the two
watched the huge tiger descend the bank and pass majestically to the
edge of the water where he stopped to quench his thirst. It seemed to
the two trembling men that it took the Lord of the Jungle fully half an
hour to drink his fill. Then, as slowly and impressively, the tiger
turned from the stream and ascended the bank. When he reached the top
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1588" href="#xd20e1588" name=
"xd20e1588">110</a>]</span>he stood there, gazing before him either as
if admiring the scenery or contemplating a meal off one of the men. The
pair scarcely dared to breathe and wild schemes of taking to their
heels to gain the centre of the stream and swim down the river shot
through their brains. At last the tiger slowly turned away from the
river and disappeared into the forest. Then, after some time, the
frightened servants hurried across the stream back to camp, and told
the Maharajah of their terrible experience. The footprints of the
animal corroborated their story and their asseveration that they had
seen a very very big tiger.</p>
<p>During one of the shoots, the <i>shikaris</i> (native sportsmen)
brought news that a rhino had been seen in a certain jungle. The guests
were much excited and a beat was organised for the next day. The
morning dawned and all set out and were soon posted to their various
positions. The front &ldquo;stop&rdquo; guns were on the bank of a
river. The Maharajah was in the beating line. When about half way
through the piece of jungle he noticed that one of his brother guns
looked disappointed. He accordingly asked &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
up?&rdquo; The guest answered that he thought that a large animal had
broken back. However <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1596" href=
"#xd20e1596" name="xd20e1596">111</a>]</span>nothing was discovered and
as it was mid-day a halt for lunch was considered desirable. A spot was
soon selected and the signal given and the lines broke up. Just as the
foremost elephants were about to kneel to permit their riders to
dismount, there arose from the &ldquo;stop&rdquo; elephants a cry of
&ldquo;Tiger&rdquo;. In the jungle, quite close to one of the
&ldquo;stop&rdquo; guns, a tiger was enjoying a feed of a wild pig; and
as the elephant turned to join the others, he almost trod on the tiger.
In a moment the line was re-organised, but the surprised tiger, finding
itself surrounded by foes, turned tail and ran down the bank of the
river. The stream was nearly dry and the bed was very shingly, and as
the startled tiger picked its way gingerly across the pebbles and pools
of water it looked like a stranded cat. It had not progressed very far
when a well-directed shot laid it low; and with this unexpected prize
the party sat down to lunch in excellent spirits. As rhino generally
fight shy of elephants, they did not think there was much use
continuing the beat after lunch. So they decided that they should make
tracks for home and have general shooting. General shooting means that
there is no beating line. A long <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e1598" href="#xd20e1598" name="xd20e1598">112</a>]</span>straight
line of march is formed, and each gun elephant is in between the pad or
beating elephants. The Maharajah was almost the last gun in the line.
Nearly all were out of the jungle when his keen and practised eye
noticed a small pad elephant jib at something as they passed through a
piece of jungle. &ldquo;Did your elephant refuse to come
through?&rdquo; he questioned the <i>mahout</i> of the small elephant.
&ldquo;Yes, Maharajah, he smelt something in the jungle,&rdquo; the man
replied. &ldquo;Beat this piece of jungle&rdquo;, the Maharajah quickly
ordered the pad elephants with him. They beat it and drove forth a
rhino which fell dead to the Maharajah&rsquo;s gun. Before His Highness
had time to take up his other rifle, a second galloped out of the
jungle and charged straight at the Maharajah&rsquo;s elephant. The
elephant spun round to avoid the furious onslaught and in the meantime
the Maharajah managed to raise his gun and, getting in his shot in
spite of the gyrations of the elephant, laid out rhino No. 2 in grand
style to the applause of his companions.</p>
<p>Coming back to camp in the dusk one evening, the Maharajah, who had
wonderful eyesight, thought he saw a tiger lying still in an open
field. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1605" href="#xd20e1605" name=
"xd20e1605">113</a>]</span>He raised his gun and whispered to his
<i>mahout</i>. As they came nearer, the tiger&mdash;for tiger it
was&mdash;raised itself to its feet and prepared to spring at the
elephant. Too late! Snap went the Maharajah&rsquo;s trigger and the
royal beast lay dead.</p>
<p>These are but a few of the shooting adventures of a
sportsman-Maharajah who has gone on the long journey from life to the
greater life beyond, but whose memory lives in the annals of Bengal as
a keen and successful shot.</p>

because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
